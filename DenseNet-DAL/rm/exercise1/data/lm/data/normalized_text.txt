SUCH SUPERVISION, ACCORDING TO ASH, IS A SENSIBLE, COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION THAT SHOULD NOT ALARM CIVIL LIBERTARIANS. <NOISE> DOCTOR NORMAN ROSENBLATT, DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE AT NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY, AGREES.

I'M IRENE DOYLE.
NEW HAMPSHIRE GOVERNOR JUDD GREG SAYS HE'S WITHDRAWING HIS REQUEST TO DELAY LOW POWER TESTING AT THE SEABROOK NUCLEAR PLANT. <NOISE> GREG ASKED FOR THE DELAY EARLIER THIS MONTH SAYING TESTING SHOULD NOT BEGIN UNTIL IT'S SURE THE PLANT WILL RUN COMMERCIALLY. <NOISE> THE STATE HAD ARGUED THAT CUSTOMER, A PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE SEABROOK'S LEAD OWNER, <NOISE> WOULD HAVE TO PAY AN ESTIMATED TWENTY-SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO DECONTAMINATE THE PLANT IF A FULL POWER LICENSE WAS DENIED. <NOISE> BUT GREG SAYS THE STATE HAS REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH PUBLIC SERVICE ENSURING THAT THE CLEANUP COSTS WOULD NOT BE PASSED ONTO RATE PAYERS. <NOISE> THE DEAL IS SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF PUBLIC SERVICE CREDITORS AND THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE OVERSEEING THE REORGANIZATION OF THE UTILITY. <NOISE> MEANWHILE, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY SAYS IT WILL DO EVERYTHING IN ITS POWER TO GET SEABROOK UP AND RUNNING. <NOISE> DEPUTY ENERGY SECRETARY HENSON MOORE SAYS THAT NEW ENGLAND'S ENERGY RESERVES COULD FALL BELOW ACCEPTABLE LEVELS AS EARLY AS NINETEEN NINETY-THREE. <NOISE> AND HE SAYS FIRING UP SEABROOK AND NEW YORK'S SHORUM REACTOR WOULD BE THE CHEAPEST AND MOST ECOLOGICAL SOLUTION TO PROJECTED SHORTAGES.

THE BRUINS ARE RESTING UP <NOISE> FOR THE START OF MONDAY, SECOND ROUND OF THE N.H.L. PLAY-OFFS <NOISE> WITH THE MONTREAL CANADIANS.
SUCH SUPERVISION, ACCORDING TO ASH, IS A SENSIBLE, COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION <NOISE> THAT SHOULD NOT ALARM CIVIL LIBERTARIANS. <NOISE> DOCTOR NORMAN ROSENBLATT, DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE AT NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY, AGREES.
ROSENBLATT EXPECTS ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE IN PAROLE SITUATIONS TO BECOME MORE WIDE SPREAD, <NOISE> AND HE THINKS EVENTUALLY PEOPLE WILL GET USED TO THE IDEA. <NOISE> SPRINGFIELD JAIL DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT ASH <NOISE> SAYS ALTHOUGH IT WILL ALLOW SOME PRISONERS TO BE RELEASED A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THEIR SENTENCES ARE UP, <NOISE> CONCERNS THAT MAY RAISE ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY ARE NOT WELL FOUNDED. <NOISE> MOST COUNTY JAIL INMATES DID NOT COMMIT VIOLENT CRIMES. <NOISE> THEY'RE IN JAIL FOR SUCH THINGS AS BAD CHECKS OR STEALING. <NOISE> THOSE ON EARLY RELEASE MUST CHECK IN WITH CORRECTIONS OFFICIALS FIFTY TIMES A WEEK ACCORDING TO ASH, <NOISE> WHO SAYS ABOUT HALF THE CONTACTS FOR A SELECT GROUP <NOISE> WILL NOW BE MADE BY THE COMPUTERIZED PHONE CALLS. <NOISE> INITIALLY THE PROGRAM WILL INVOLVE ONLY A HANDFUL OF INMATES. <NOISE> ASH SAYS THE ULTIMATE GOAL <NOISE> IS TO USE IT TO GET ABOUT FORTY OUT OF JAIL EARLY. <NOISE> THE SPRINGFIELD JAIL, BUILT FOR TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY PEOPLE, <NOISE> NOW HOUSES MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
A NINETEEN- EIGHTEEN STATE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT MADE MASSACHUSETTS ONE OF TWENTY- THREE STATES <NOISE> WHERE CITIZENS CAN ENACT LAWS BY PLEBISCITE. <NOISE> THE FIRST BALLOT INITIATIVE ADOPTED BY BAY STATERS <NOISE> WAS A NINETEEN- TWENTY MEASURE <NOISE> THAT DEFINED CIDER AND BEER AS NON-INTOXICATING, EXEMPTING THEM FROM PROHIBITION. <NOISE> A NINETEEN- FORTY- EIGHT INITIATIVE TO LEGALIZE CONTRACEPTIVES WAS DEFEATED, <NOISE> BUT PERHAPS THE STATE'S MOST FAMOUS INITIATIVE WAS PROPOSITION TWO AND A HALF, <NOISE> ONE IN A SERIES OF RECENT ANTI-TAX MEASURES ON BALLOTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. <NOISE> SINCE NINETEEN- SIXTY- EIGHT, <NOISE> VOTER INITIATED PROPOSITIONS HAVE MUSHROOMED BY MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED PERCENT. <NOISE> HEIGHTENED AWARENESS OF THE PROCESS <NOISE> MAY BE ONE REASON WHY MORE PETITIONS WERE CERTIFIED THIS YEAR IN MASSACHUSETTS THAN EVER BEFORE, <NOISE> SAYS THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S CHIEF LEGAL COUNSEL, DAVID SULLIVAN.
IN A STUDY OF SEVENTY- TWO BALLOT ISSUES IN MASSACHUSETTS AND THREE OTHER STATES, <NOISE> BOSTON UNIVERSITY POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR, BETTY ZISK, <NOISE> FOUND THAT EIGHTY- EIGHT PERCENT OF THE BATTLES WERE WON BY THE SIDE THAT SPENT THE MOST MONEY. <NOISE> STILL, ZISK APPLAUDS VOTER INITIATIVES <NOISE> SAYING THEY SHOULDN'T BE HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD <NOISE> THAN LAWS ENACTED BY LEGISLATURES.
THE POLICY ALSO IS HUMILIATING SAYS JOANNE LEARD, <NOISE> A UNION HEALTH AND SAFETY MONITOR <NOISE> WHO'S WORKED AT JOHNSON CONTROLS FOR SIXTEEN YEARS.
AND VIRGINIA GREEN SAYS, IN HER CASE, THE POLICY IS INFURIATING. <NOISE> SHE'D HAD HER CHILDREN BEFORE SHE BEGAN WORKING AT JOHNSON CONTROLS <NOISE> AND DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT LEAD EXPOSURE. <NOISE> IN FACT, GREEN SAYS SHE ENJOYED HER JOB AS A PLATE STACKER, <NOISE> BUT WHEN THE FETAL PROTECTION POLICY TOOK EFFECT, <NOISE> GREEN WAS TRANSFERRED TO A LOW LEAD AREA. HER BASE SALARY REMAINED THE SAME, <NOISE> BUT SHE LOST INCENTIVE PAY. <NOISE> GREEN WAS FIFTY YEARS OLD AT THE TIME.
GREEN, SEVERAL OF HER BENNINGTON CO-WORKERS, AND EMPLOYEES AT SOME OF JOHNSON CONTROLS' FIFTEEN OTHER MANUFACTURING PLANTS FILED GRIEVANCES <NOISE> WHICH LED TO A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. <NOISE> COMPANY OFFICIALS REFUSED TO COMMENT, <NOISE> BUT THEIR POSITION PAPER ON THE FETAL PROTECTION POLICY <NOISE> MAINTAINS THAT CERTAIN BLOOD LEAD LEVELS WHILE SAFE FOR ADULTS, <NOISE> CAUSE BIRTH DEFECTS IF PASSED THROUGH THE PLACENTA TO A FETUS. <NOISE> ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENT, <NOISE> IT WOULD BE MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE <NOISE> TO KNOWINGLY POISON UNBORN CHILDREN BY ALLOWING FERTILE WOMEN TO WORK IN HIGH LEAD AREAS. <NOISE> DOCTOR JAY JULIAN CHISM, <NOISE> DIRECTOR OF THE KENNEDY INSTITUTE'S LEAD PROGRAM AT JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, <NOISE> HAS STUDIED LEAD POISONING FOR SOME THIRTY- FIVE YEARS. <NOISE> IN THE CASE AGAINST JOHNSON CONTROLS, <NOISE> CHISM PROVIDED AN AFFIDAVIT ON THE COMPANY'S BEHALF. <NOISE> HE SAYS, UNLESS LEAD STANDARDS ARE LOWERED THROUGHOUT THE WORKPLACE, <NOISE> THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE THAT FETUSES ARE NOT AT RISK <NOISE> IS TO REMOVE FROM LEAD AREAS <NOISE> ANYONE WHO MAY BECOME PREGNANT.
OTHER OPPONENTS SAY THE ISSUE FOR JOHNSON CONTROLS IS NOT FETAL PROTECTION, <NOISE> BUT PROTECTING THE COMPANY FROM LAWSUITS SHOULD AN EMPLOYEE'S CHILD HAVE BIRTH DEFECTS. <NOISE> IF THE MOTHER NEVER WORKED IN A LEAD AREA, THE THEORY GOES, <NOISE> SHE CAN'T BLAME JOHNSON CONTROLS. <NOISE> THE U.A.W. HAS UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR TO PETITION THE U.S. SUPREME COURT TO HEAR THE CASE. <NOISE> IF THE POLICY STANDS, <NOISE> CRITICS SAY IT WILL INSTITUTIONALIZE THE SECOND CLASS EMPLOYMENT STATUS OF ALL FERTILE WOMEN <NOISE> AND HIGHER PAYING, ALBEIT MORE HAZARDOUS JOBS <NOISE> WILL BE RESERVED FOR MEN. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
THIS IS MARGO MELNICOVE. AT A NEWS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY IN MISSION HILL, NEAR THE SITE OF THE STUART SHOOTINGS, <NOISE> BOSTON MAYOR RAY FLYNN VEHEMENTLY DENIED CHARGES THAT THERE'S A DOUBLE STANDARD IN THE CITY, <NOISE> THAT WHITE LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN BLACK LIFE.
"THE PROBLEM", SAID FLYNN "IS THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH FINANCIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES <NOISE> TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE." <NOISE> FEDERAL AND STATE BUDGET CUTS HAVE CREATED A PUBLIC SERVICE CRISIS HE SAID, <NOISE> WITH DRUG TREATMENT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ONLY TWO OF THE CASUALTIES. <NOISE> FLYNN OFFERED A REMEDY THAT HE ADMITS IS NOT LIKELY TO BE POPULAR.
FLYNN SAID, WITH LOCAL OPTION TAXES, SUCH AS AN INCREASE IN SALES TAX, <NOISE> THE MONEY GOES TO THE COMMUNITY THAT GENERATES IT. <NOISE> FOR EXAMPLE, A ONE CENT SALES TAX INCREASE, SAID FLYNN, <NOISE> WOULD ADD THIRTY- FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO THE CITY'S TREASURY. <NOISE> THE MAYOR SAID, SOON HE'LL SEEK LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL OF SUCH A TAX <NOISE> WITH BOSTON'S SHARE EARMARKED FOR PUBLIC SAFETY, <NOISE> YOUTH OUTREACH PROGRAMS, <NOISE> AND EDUCATIONAL REFORM. <NOISE> YESTERDAY, THE BOSTON CITY COUNCIL CALLED FOR AN EMERGENCY MEETING WITH FLYNN NEXT MONDAY <NOISE> TO PUT OTHER STRATEGIES ON THE TABLE, <NOISE> INCLUDING A NEW COURT TO HANDLE DRUG RELATED CASES, <NOISE> EXPANSION OF NEIGHBORHOOD CRIME WATCH EFFORTS <NOISE> AND A BEEFED UP BUDGET FOR POLICE. <NOISE> THESE IDEAS HAVE BEEN FLOATED BEFORE. <NOISE> LOUIS ALISA, PRESIDENT OF THE N DOUBLE ACP'S BOSTON BRANCH, SAYS IT'S SAD THAT IT TAKES THE DEATH OF A WHITE WOMAN FROM THE SUBURBS <NOISE> TO CREATE AN URGENCY TO RID BOSTON OF DRUGS, POVERTY AND GUNS.
BOSTON IS ALREADY DIVIDED, SAYS BOSCAN, IN TERMS OF CLASS, RACE AND ETHNICITY. <NOISE> AND IN A FRAGMENTED CITY HE SAYS, <NOISE> ONE FINDS A GREAT DEAL OF VIOLENCE. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
REGANBURG SAYS, IF STATE FINANCES IMPROVE, BENEFITS MAY BECOME AVAILABLE TO ILLEGAL ALIENS AGAIN, <NOISE> BUT SEVERAL LEGISLATORS HAVE FILED BILLS TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. <NOISE> REPUBLICAN SENATOR DAVID LOCK'S BILL <NOISE> WOULD PERMANENTLY DENY ILLEGAL ALIENS ALL STATE BENEFITS EXCEPT EMERGENCY MEDICAL ASSISTANCE.
REGULATIONS BANNING GENERAL RELIEF FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS TAKE EFFECT NEXT MONTH. <NOISE> WHETHER OR NOT THE BAN BECOMES PERMANENT UNDER A NEW LAW, <NOISE> ALTMAN SAYS THE CHANGE WILL BE CHALLENGED IN COURT. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT MUST INSPECT EVERYTHING FROM MILK PLANTS TO HOSPITALS TO POLICE STATION LOCKUPS. <NOISE> STATE INSPECTORS ALSO ASSIST LOCAL BOARDS OF HEALTH. <NOISE> THESE PART- TIME BOARDS ARE THE ONLY HEALTH INSPECTORS IN ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY- TWO SMALL MASSACHUSETTS COMMUNITIES, <NOISE> SO STATE WORKERS OFTEN STEP IN <NOISE> TO SURVEY RESTAURANTS, SEPTIC SYSTEMS, HOUSING. <NOISE> AND TOWNS THAT EMPLOY FULLTIME PUBLIC HEALTH AGENTS <NOISE> OFTEN TURN TO THE STATE FOR TRAINING. <NOISE> STATE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPUTY COMMISSIONER VAN DUNN <NOISE> ADMITS RECENT LAYOFFS WILL MEAN LESS HELP FOR LOCAL BOARDS, <NOISE> AND MAY MAKE THE STATE MORE REACTIVE THAN PREVENTION ORIENTED. <NOISE> DUNN SAYS THE FOOD AND DRUG DIVISION, FOR EXAMPLE, <NOISE> EXPECTS ITS ANNUAL INSPECTIONS TO DROP BY FIFTEEN HUNDRED. <NOISE> BUT DUNN SAYS, WITH SOME STAFF RESHUFFLING, HE'LL MAKE THE BEST OF A BAD SITUATION <NOISE> AND CONTINUE TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH.
THIS SOUNDS LIKE A PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY, TO GREATER BOSTON LEGAL SERVICES HOUSING ATTORNEY, JEFF PURCELL, <NOISE> WHO SAYS NEAR ELIMINATION OF STATE SANITARIANS <NOISE> PORTENDS A TENANT'S RIGHTS CRISIS. <NOISE> THE STATE USED TO EMPLOY SEVEN SANITARIANS, NOW TWO MUST COVER ALL OF MASSACHUSETTS. <NOISE> THEIR WORK IS CUT OUT FOR THEM, <NOISE> WITH INSPECTIONS OF PRISONS, STATE OPERATED CAMP GROUNDS, AND SWIMMING POOLS <NOISE> AND FARM LABOR CAMPS REQUIRED BY LAW. <NOISE> PURCELL SAYS THERE'S NO WAY THEY CAN ALSO TAKE ON <NOISE> THE SANITARIAN'S TRADITIONAL ROLE OF INSPECTOR OF LAST RESORT, <NOISE> WHEN LOCAL OFFICIALS FAIL TO CRACK DOWN ON SLUM LORDS.
PURCELL WARNS THAT, THIS WINTER, MORE TENANTS THAN USUAL WILL HAVE TO PUT UP WITH INADEQUATE HEAT AND HOT WATER <NOISE> WHILE THEY AWAIT A STATE SANITARIAN WHO MAY NEVER SHOW. <NOISE> DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF HEALTHCARE QUALITY, PRISCILLA PLATO, <NOISE> SAYS DELAYS ARE ALSO EXPECTED <NOISE> IN RE-LICENSURE INSPECTIONS AT REST HOMES, HOSPITALS AND CLINICS.
RE-LICENSURE INSPECTIONS USED TO OCCUR EVERY TWO YEARS, BUT NOW THEY WILL HAPPEN EVERY FOUR OR SIX YEARS SAYS PLATO <NOISE> WHOSE DIVISION THIS WEEK LOST TWELVE PERCENT OF ITS INSPECTION WORK FORCE. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
ICE IS A SMOKABLE, POTENT FORM OF METHAMPHETAMINE OR SPEED. <NOISE> A FEW HITS BRING ON A HIGH THAT LASTS FOR HOURS. <NOISE> ICE WREAKS HAVOC ON THE BODY CAUSING INCREASED BLOOD PRESSURE, TREMORS, ACNE AND OTHER PHYSICAL DAMAGE. <NOISE> BUT DOCTOR ALONSO PLOW, BOSTON CITY HOSPITAL'S DEPUTY COMMISSIONER FOR PUBLIC HEALTH, <NOISE> SAYS WHAT'S MOST ALARMING <NOISE> ARE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ICE, ONCE THE INITIAL EUPHORIA SUBSIDES.
PLOW SAYS IN SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA, NEARLY ONE THIRD OF ALL HOMICIDES NOW INVOLVE PEOPLE HIGH ON ICE. <NOISE> BUT BY THE TIME THE DRUG SHOWS UP IN BOSTON, <NOISE> PLOW HOPES THE WORD ON THE STREET WILL BE THAT PLAYING WITH ICE IS IN FACT PLAYING WITH FIRE. <NOISE> THE HOSPITAL, THE MAYOR'S OFFICE, THE SCHOOL SYSTEM, POLICE AND OTHERS <NOISE> ARE WORKING ON AN EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN ABOUT THE DANGERS OF ICE. <NOISE> NO ONE KNOWS HOW MUCH TIME THEY'LL HAVE TO WARN POTENTIAL USERS. <NOISE> LOS ANGELES POLICE DETECTIVE, MILT DODGE, <NOISE> SAYS ICE IS BEGINNING TO SURFACE IN HIS CITY <NOISE> WITH A COUPLE OF SMALL SEIZURES MADE THE LAST FEW DAYS.
DODGE SAYS PREVENTION EFFORTS IN L.A., RUN THE GAMUT, INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON A PARTICULAR DRUG. <NOISE> IN CHICAGO, A POLICE SPOKESWOMAN SAYS <NOISE> THERE'S FEAR THAT PUBLICITY WILL ONLY AROUSE DEMAND FOR ICE, <NOISE> SO UNTIL THE DRUG HITS CHICAGO, THERE'LL BE NO CAMPAIGN AGAINST IT. <NOISE> BUT IN BOSTON, DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF THE DRUG CONTROL UNIT, JAMES WOOD, <NOISE> SAYS INFORMATION IS THE BEST WEAPON. <NOISE> WOOD APPLAUDS THE UPCOMING CAMPAIGN, WHICH WILL BE SIMILAR TO A MEDIA AND CLASSROOM BLITZ WAGED A FEW YEARS AGO <NOISE> AFTER NEW YORK POLICE TIPPED OFF BOSTON <NOISE> THAT SMOKABLE COCAINE OR CRACK, WAS HEADED NORTH.
BOSTON CITY COUNSELOR DAVID SCONDRAS WHO'S GAY IS PLENTY ANGRY, <NOISE> BUT NOT AT BARNEY FRANK WHO PAID FOR SEX WHEN HE WAS STILL IN THE CLOSET. <NOISE> SCONDRAS BLAMES FRANK'S MISCONDUCT <NOISE> ON A HOMOPHOBIC SOCIETY THAT FORCES MOST GAYS <NOISE> TO LIVE SECRET LIVES.
SO WHY HASN'T THE GAY COMMUNITY RALLIED AROUND FRANK WITH A MARCH OR OTHER SHOW OF WIDESPREAD SUPPORT? <NOISE> BAY WINDOWS' EPPERLY SAYS PEOPLE ARE WAITING TO SEE IF THE DEBATE ESCALATES <NOISE> INTO A OVERT ATTACK AGAINST GAYS IN GENERAL. <NOISE> DAVID SCONDRAS SAYS <NOISE> MANY GAYS ARE STILL AFRAID TO COME OUT OF THE CLOSET TO TAKE A PUBLIC STAND. <NOISE> BUT THIS CUSTOMER AT FRITZ'S HAS ANOTHER THEORY.
SOME POLLSTERS SAY VOTERS MOST LIKELY TO BE TURNED OFF BY FRANK'S CONDUCT <NOISE> ARE NEWCOMERS TO THE DISTRICT WHO ARE UNAWARE OF HIS POLITICAL RECORD, <NOISE> AND CONSERVATIVE BLUE COLLAR, ETHNIC DEMOCRATS <NOISE> WHO MAY HAVE TOLERATED FRANK'S HOMOSEXUALITY BEFORE, <NOISE> BUT NOW ARE DISTURBED BY A MALE PROSTITUTE'S CLAIM <NOISE> THAT HE CONDUCTED BUSINESS OUT OF FRANK'S WASHINGTON APARTMENT.
BUT HENRY WILLSEY, HEAD OF THE STATE'S NATURAL HERITAGE AND ENDANGERED SPECIES PROGRAM, <NOISE> SAYS THE MEASURE WOULD AFFECT RELATIVELY FEW ACRES, PERHAPS ONLY SEVENTY- FIVE HUNDRED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. <NOISE> WILLSEY'S PROGRAM HAS SPENT THE LAST DECADE <NOISE> COLLECTING DATA ON RARE SPECIES AND HE KNOWS WHERE THEY ARE: <NOISE> CAPE COD AND THE ISLANDS, THE SOUTH SHORE NEAR PLYMOUTH <NOISE> AND PARTS OF THE BERKSHIRES TO NAME A FEW CRITICAL HABITAT AREAS. <NOISE> BUT WILLSEY SAYS HE WON'T PUBLICIZE SPECIFIC SITES <NOISE> UNTIL AFTER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES BILL BECOMES LAW. <NOISE> THE ISSUE HE SAYS SHOULD NOT BE INFLUENCED BY POLITICS AND WHO OWNS WHAT PROPERTY, <NOISE> BUT SHOULD BE BASED ON BIOLOGY.
CRITICS OF THE PROPOSED LAW SAY THE STATE CAN'T AFFORD IT IN THESE FINANCIALLY TROUBLED TIMES, <NOISE> BUT WILLSEY SAYS THE BILL WOULD BE MOSTLY FUNDED BY VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS ON STATE INCOME TAX FORMS <NOISE> AND HE SAYS THERE'S TEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM BOND SALES FOR HABITAT ACQUISITION ON HAND <NOISE> SHOULD THE STATE HAVE TO BUY OUT SOME LAND OWNERS. <NOISE> BUT DEVELOPERS SAY LAND TAKINGS UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES BILL WOULD BE INEQUITABLE IF NOT ILLEGAL <NOISE> AND THE STATE MAY BE HIT WITH A SERIES OF COSTLY LAWSUITS. <NOISE> THE MEASURE'S PRICE TAG WILL BE REVIEWED BY THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE. <NOISE> GREENFIELD REPRESENTATIVE, CARMEN BULE, A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE AND SPONSOR OF THE BILL <NOISE> IS HOPING FOR TIMELY CONSIDERATION.
IF THE MEASURE WINS THE LEGISLATURE'S FINAL APPROVAL BEFORE THIS SESSION ENDS, <NOISE> IT WILL TAKE AT LEAST A YEAR TO FINALIZE REGULATIONS <NOISE> AND TO PUBLICLY OUTLINE THE HABITAT OF THE STATE'S MOST ENDANGERED SPECIES. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
THE CONTRACT WAS UNVEILED LAST MAY AFTER EIGHT MONTHS OF NEGOTIATIONS AND HAILED BY EDUCATORS AS HISTORIC. <NOISE> THE PACT BETWEEN THE TEACHER'S UNION AND THE SCHOOL DEPARTMENT <NOISE> CALLS FOR AN UNPRECEDENTED SHIFT OF POWER FROM CENTRAL OFFICE ADMINISTRATORS <NOISE> TO THOSE WHO KNOW EACH SCHOOL BEST: <NOISE> TEACHERS, PARENTS AND STUDENTS. <NOISE> IT'S CALLED SCHOOL BASED MANAGEMENT AND BOSTON TEACHERS UNION PRESIDENT ED DOUGHERTY <NOISE> TOUTS IT AS ESSENTIAL TO TURNING AROUND THE CITY'S TROUBLED SCHOOL SYSTEM.
WHEN THE CONTRACT WAS ANNOUNCED, BOSTON MAYOR RAY FLYNN PRAISED THE REFORMS IT PROMISES, <NOISE> BUT IN THE NEXT BREATH HE CAUTIONED <NOISE> THAT THE CITY WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO PAY FOR THE EIGHTY- NINE MILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE. <NOISE> SINCE THEN, THE CITY'S FINANCIAL OUTLOOK HAS BECOME EVEN GLOOMIER. <NOISE> IN AN EFFORT TO AVERT TODAY'S WALKOUT, <NOISE> FLYNN OFFERED TO FUND A ONE YEAR CONTRACT <NOISE> BUT THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE UNION TO NEGOTIATE A WHOLE NEW AGREEMENT. <NOISE> ED DOUGHERTY SAYS THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
SOME PEOPLE BLAME THE DUKAKIS ADMINISTRATION FOR IT'S BUDGET BUNGLING AND CUTS IN LOCAL AID, <NOISE> OTHERS THE LEGISLATURE FOR ITS FAILURE TO APPROVE NEW TAXES, <NOISE> BUT MANY TEACHERS AND PARENTS BLAME MAYOR FLYNN <NOISE> SAYING HE SHOULD HAVE WORKED HARDER ON BEHALF OF THE CONTRACT <NOISE> INSTEAD OF POLITICING FOR AN APPOINTED SCHOOL COMMITTEE. <NOISE> SOME TEACHERS THEORIZE THAT FLYNN'S TRYING TO GET BACK AT THE UNION <NOISE> FOR HAVING OPPOSED HIS REFERENDUM ON SCHOOL COMMITTEE RESTRUCTURING. <NOISE> BUT DOUGHERTY HAS ANOTHER THEORY, <NOISE> HE SAYS THE MAYOR JUST DOESN'T WANT THE CONTRACT FUNDED.
JEFF CONLEY HEADS THE BOSTON FINANCE COMMISSION, A WATCHDOG AGENCY CREATED BY THE CITY CHARTER.
THE UNION ESTIMATES THAT AT LEAST THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ARE AVAILABLE IN UNSPENT MONEY FROM LAST YEAR, <NOISE> BUT CONLEY SAYS THAT AMOUNTS TO ONLY TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND SEVERAL BUDGET ITEMS ARE VYING FOR THE FUNDS. <NOISE> THE MAYOR'S EDUCATION ADVISOR, ELLEN GUINY, <NOISE> SAYS IT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE FOR FLYNN TO COMMIT TO THE THREE YEAR CONTRACT GIVEN CURRENT REVENUE FORECASTS, <NOISE> BUT SHE SAYS THOSE WHO CRITICIZE THE MAYOR FOR BACKING DOWN ON HIS COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION <NOISE> ARE WRONG.
GUINY SAYS THE MAYOR INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR NEW TAXES <NOISE> AND PERHAPS WITHIN A MONTH OR TWO, <NOISE> THE POLITICAL WINDS WILL SHIFT ENOUGH IN HIS DIRECTION <NOISE> TO ALLOW HIM TO SUPPORT THE TEACHER'S CONTRACT. <NOISE> THE UNION'S ED DOUGHERTY SAYS <NOISE> HE WON'T KNOW UNTIL AFTER A BOARD MEETING NEXT WEEK JUST HOW LONG THE UNION CAN WAIT <NOISE> BEFORE CALLING FOR A FULL- SCALE STRIKE. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
THE TEEN HEALTH CENTER AT CAMBRIDGE RINGE AND LATIN IS VISITED ABOUT ONE THOUSAND TIMES EACH MONTH BY STUDENTS SEEKING EVERYTHING FROM ASPIRIN TO IMMUNIZATIONS <NOISE> TO PRENATAL CARE. <NOISE> WITHIN A FEW WEEKS, CONDOMS WILL BE ADDED TO THE LIST. <NOISE> IT HASN'T BEEN DETERMINED EXACTLY WHO WILL DISPENSE THEM <NOISE> OR HOW MANY A STUDENT WILL BE ALLOWED TO BUY AT ONE TIME, <NOISE> BUT HEALTH CENTER DIRECTOR, LYNN CHOAFE, SAYS THESE THINGS ARE CERTAIN: <NOISE> ONLY LATEX CONDOMS WITH SPERMICIDE, THE MOST EFFECTIVE AT PREVENTING TRANSMISSION OF THE AIDS VIRUS, WILL BE AVAILABLE. <NOISE> AND CHOAFE SAYS STUDENTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO UNDERGO COUNSELING <NOISE> THE FIRST TIME THEY COME TO THE CLINIC FOR CONDOMS.
BUT SENIOR EMILY CASE SAYS IF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE TINKERS WITH THE POLICY, <NOISE> HER AIDS PEER LEADERSHIP GROUP <NOISE> MAY BE FORCED TO RESUME CONDOM DISTRIBUTION.
ASSUMING THE TEEN HEALTH CENTER'S PROGRAM GETS OFF THE GROUND, <NOISE> CASE SAYS SHE'LL REFER HER FORMER CUSTOMERS TO THE CLINIC. <NOISE> BUT IF SOMEONE'S AFRAID TO TALK TO ADULTS, <NOISE> CASE SAYS SHE WON'T LET THAT STUDENT WALK AWAY EMPTY HANDED. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
IF THE BEGINNING OF OUR INTERVIEW WAS ANY INDICATION, <NOISE> JULIE BALLAGA'S REPUTATION AS AN ENTHUSIASTIC ACCESSIBLE PERSON IS WELL DESERVED. <NOISE> HER CORNER OFFICE IN BOSTON HAS A FINE VIEW OF THE CHARLES RIVER, <NOISE> BUT A POOR BACKGROUND FOR RECORDING DUE TO A NOISY HEATING SYSTEM. <NOISE> INSTEAD OF ASKING AN AIDE TO FIND US A QUIET OFFICE, <NOISE> BALLAGA LEAD THE SEARCH.
FIFTY- NINE YEAR OLD BALLAGA FIRST GOT INVOLVED IN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AS A TOWN PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSIONER, <NOISE> THEN AS A MEMBER OF THE CONNECTICUT HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WHERE SHE SPENT MUCH OF HER TEN YEAR STINT ON THE ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE. <NOISE> SHE INSISTS HER HUSBAND'S WORK AS AN OIL COMPANY EXECUTIVE, <NOISE> NEVER COLORED HER THINKING. <NOISE> BALLAGA SAYS, IN FACT, SHE TAUGHT HIM <NOISE> THE ENVIRONMENTAL WAY. <NOISE> SHE CARRIED HER MESSAGE STATEWIDE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY- SIX AS CONNECTICUT'S REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR <NOISE> AGAINST INCUMBENT WILLIAM O'NEIL.
O'NEIL TROUNCED BALLAGA, BUT SHE SAYS SHE HAS NO REGRETS ABOUT HAVING RUN. <NOISE> APPARENTLY, HER POLITICING OVER THE YEARS HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE; <NOISE> IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIND A BALLAGA ENEMY. <NOISE> WANDA RICURBEE, NOW WITH CONNECTICUT'S ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION DEPARTMENT, <NOISE> WAS AN ENVIRONMENTAL LOBBYIST WHEN BALLAGA WAS A LEGISLATOR.
HEAD OF GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS FOR THE HARTFORD CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, JOSEPH IERNA, <NOISE> IS ANOTHER LONGTIME BALLAGA OBSERVER.
MASSACHUSETTS WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY DIRECTOR, PAUL LEVY, <NOISE> SAYS BALLAGA IS SINCERELY COMMITTED TO PRO-ENVIRONMENT GOALS. <NOISE> HER PREDECESSOR MICHAEL DELAND <NOISE> STARTED THE CLEAN-UP OF BOSTON HARBOR. <NOISE> LEVY IS CONFIDENT BALLAGA WILL KEEP THE PROJECT ON TRACK.
IF HE CALLS, BALLAGA SAYS SHE'LL GIVE SUNUNU A FAIR HEARING <NOISE> JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
A DECADE AGO, THERE WERE THREE REPORTED AIDS CASES IN MASSACHUSETTS. NOW THERE ARE THREE THOUSAND. <NOISE> AND IT'S ESTIMATED THAT EVERY DAY, SIX MORE BAYSTATERS BECOME INFECTED WITH THE AIDS VIRUS. <NOISE> IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF NINETEEN NINETY ALONE, <NOISE> HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY, PHILLIP JOHNSTON, SAYS TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY- ONE MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN <NOISE> WERE DIAGNOSED AS HAVING FULL BLOWN AIDS.
JOHNSTON SAYS ONE CHANGE THAT WOULD HELP CURB THE EPIDEMIC WOULD BE LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT FOR HIGHER TAXES. <NOISE> WITHOUT ADDITIONAL REVENUES, <NOISE> JOHNSTON SAYS THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR AIDS PREVENTION PROGRAMS <NOISE> WON'T REACH ENOUGH PEOPLE. <NOISE> AND WHILE HE APPLAUDED PRESIDENT BUSH'S RECENT REMARKS UNDERSCORING THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AIDS EPIDEMIC, <NOISE> JOHNSTON SAYS ATTITUDES AT THE WHITE HOUSE MUST ALSO CHANGE.
WHEN ASKED WHETHER ANY CHANGES ARE NEEDED IN HIS OFFICE, <NOISE> JOHNSTON SAYS HE MAY RE-EVALUATE A PROHIBITION AGAINST CONDOMS IN STATE PRISONS <NOISE> EVEN THOUGH SEX AMONG INMATES IS ILLEGAL. <NOISE> JOHNSTON SAYS GIVEN PRISON OVERCROWDING <NOISE> AND THE FACT THAT FIFTEEN PERCENT OF INMATES WHO VOLUNTEERED TO BE TESTED ARE INFECTED WITH THE AIDS VIRUS, <NOISE> THE POLICY DESERVES A SECOND LOOK. <NOISE> BUT WHEN ASKED IF THE STATE SHOULD RECONSIDER ITS POLICY AGAINST GIVING STERILE NEEDLES TO I-V DRUG USERS, <NOISE> PUBLIC HEALTH COMMISSIONER DAVID MULLIGAN SAYS NO. <NOISE> TREATMENT SAYS MULLIGAN IS THE KEY TO STEMMING THE SPREAD OF AIDS AMONG ADDICTS.
BUT AIDS ACTION COMMITTEE DIRECTOR LARRY KESLER, <NOISE> SAYS MORE AGGRESSIVE POLICIES AND MUCH MORE MONEY ARE NEEDED ON ALL FRONTS FROM FEDERAL AGENCIES TO CITIES AND TOWNS. <NOISE> THE GREATER BOSTON AREA, SAYS KESLER, <NOISE> USED TO RANK EIGHTH AMONG MAJOR CITIES FOR INCIDENCE OF AIDS. <NOISE> BUT KESLER SAYS OTHER CITIES WITH FEW PREVENTION PROGRAMS HAVE MOVED UP ON THE LIST AND BOSTON IS NOW THIRTEENTH.
KESLER SAYS IT WILL TAKE AN ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE AIDS PREVENTION FUNDS NEXT YEAR <NOISE> TO GET THAT MESSAGE ACROSS. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
SCOTT HARSHBARGER IS NO STRANGER TO PARTY INFIGHTING. HE CHALLENGED A DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT IN AN UNSUCCESSFUL BID FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY- EIGHT. <NOISE> THEN AGAIN IN EIGHTY- TWO WHEN HE WON THE SEAT. <NOISE> APPARENTLY, THE FORMER HARVARD FOOTBALL PLAYER ISN'T A QUITTER, <NOISE> BUT HE AND JAMES SHANNON HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON <NOISE> THAT MANY OBSERVERS WONDER WHY HARSHBARGER WANTS TO UPSET THE DEMOCRATIC APPLECART THIS TIME AROUND. <NOISE> BOTH CANDIDATES ARE YOUNG, <NOISE> BOTH REFLECT THE PARTY'S LIBERAL LEANINGS AND SUPPORT ABORTION RIGHTS. <NOISE> BUT HARSHBARGER WITH TWENTY YEARS EXPERIENCE IN CRIMINAL AND CIVIL COURTS <NOISE> SAYS HE'S MORE QUALIFIED TO BE THE STATE'S TOP LAWYER THAN SHANNON <NOISE> WHO WAS A CONGRESSMAN BEFORE HE WAS ELECTED ATTORNEY GENERAL.
AS AN EXAMPLE, THE TWO- TERM DISTRICT ATTORNEY CITES WHAT HE CALLS THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM'S <NOISE> STATE OF TOTAL CRISIS.
ATTORNEY GENERAL JAMES SHANNON.
SHANNON PRIDES HIMSELF ON HAVING CREATED A NARCOTICS UNIT AND A PUBLIC INTEGRITY DIVISION <NOISE> WHICH ARE WAGING AGGRESSIVE WARS, HE SAYS, <NOISE> AGAINST DRUGS AND POLITICAL CORRUPTION. <NOISE> SHANNON'S BEST KNOWN HOWEVER, FOR HIS ANTI-SEABROOK CRUSADE. <NOISE> THAT BATTLE ACTUALLY BEGAN UNDER HARSHBARGER <NOISE> WHO FILED THE STATE'S FIRST BRIEF IN THE SEABROOK POWER PLANT CASE <NOISE> AS AN ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL SOME FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. <NOISE> SHANNON SAYS IT'S HIS JOB TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT, <NOISE> BUT HARSHBARGER SAYS SHANNON'S TAKEN IT TOO FAR <NOISE> BECAUSE HE'S MORE PREOCCUPIED WITH THE NEWS HEADLINES THAN WITH THE LEGAL MERITS.
HARSHBARGER MAY HAVE A POINT, SAYS POLLSTER JERRY TRAVINSKY, <NOISE> BUT IT'S NOT COMPELLING ENOUGH TO CONVINCE VOTERS TO UNSEAT AN INCUMBENT. <NOISE> NOR SAYS TRAVINSKY IS HARSHBARGER'S CLAIM THAT HE'S THE MORE QUALIFIED CANDIDATE.
TRAVINSKY SAYS ANOTHER PROBLEM FOR HARSHBARGER IS THAT HE AND SHANNON ARE CUT FROM THE SAME IDEOLOGICAL CLOTH, <NOISE> PROVIDING LITTLE REASON FOR PEOPLE TO SWITCH THEIR VOTES. <NOISE> IN FACT IT'S DIFFICULT TO TELL THE CANDIDATES APART WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES.
SCOTT HARSHBARGER SAYS HE'S CONFIDENT HE'LL WIN ENOUGH CONVENTION DELEGATES TO SECURE A PLACE ON THE PRIMARY BALLOT, <NOISE> SO BETWEEN NOW AND SEPTEMBER'S ELECTION, <NOISE> HARSHBARGER SAYS HE'LL PUT ALL HIS RESOURCES INTO DISTINGUISHING HIMSELF <NOISE> FROM THE INCUMBENT JAMES SHANNON. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
KAHN SAYS GANGS USE THE LATEST COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES, <NOISE> BEEPERS, CAR PHONES, PORTABLE POLICE SCANNERS AND THE LIKE, <NOISE> TO STAY AT LEAST ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE COPS. <NOISE> HE SAYS FIVE GANGS HAVE JOINED FORCES IN A MEGA-MERGER, <NOISE> GIVING THEM MORE BANG, AS WELL AS MORE DRUGS AND GUNS, FOR THE BUCK. <NOISE> AND HE SAYS THERE ARE ABOUT TEN UP AND COMING GIRL GANGS.
BOSTON POLICE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT, WILLIAM SELESTER, IS IN CHARGE OF THE MATTAPAN ROXBURY AREA. <NOISE> SELESTER SAYS ONCE THERE WERE TWO GIRL GANGS WITH THIRTEEN MEMBERS EACH <NOISE> BUT THEY DIDN'T LAST. <NOISE> HE SAYS MEGA-MERGERS HAVE BEEN TRIED BUT NEVER SUCCEEDED <NOISE> BECAUSE GANGS CAN'T GET ALONG <NOISE> AND HE SAYS YOU'D HAVE TO COUNT, AS HE PUTS IT, EVERY PAIN IN THE NECK GROUP THAT DRINKS BEER ON A STREET CORNER <NOISE> FOR GANG MEMBERSHIP TO APPROACH FOUR TO SIX THOUSAND. <NOISE> SELESTER SAYS AT MOST THERE ARE ONLY SIX HUNDRED REAL GANG MEMBERS IN THE CITY <NOISE> AND OF THOSE, ONLY TWO HUNDRED ARE HARD CORE VIOLENT CRIMINALS. <NOISE> HE DISMISSES CLAIMS BY THE PHOENIX THAT POLICE DOWNPLAY THE SITUATION. <NOISE> THE MEDIA, SAYS SELESTER, OVERSTATE THE PROBLEM <NOISE> AND MOST IGNORE HIS PLEA NOT TO PUBLICIZE GANGS' NAMES. <NOISE> SELESTER SAYS SUCH PUBLICITY ENCOURAGES GANG MEMBERS BY FEEDING THEIR HUNGER FOR STATUS. <NOISE> STILL, SELESTER SAYS HIS FORCES ARE MAKING HEADWAY.
WILKERSON SAYS IT'S NO WONDER THAT YOUNGSTERS WITHOUT REAL ALTERNATIVES <NOISE> FIND THE LURE OF BIG DRUG PROFITS HARD TO RESIST. <NOISE> AND SHE SAYS THE NEWS THAT THIS TEMPTATION IS NOT LIMITED TO ANY PARTICULAR RACE OR NEIGHBORHOOD <NOISE> ALSO COMES AS NO SURPRISE. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
JOHNSON'S FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SON CHARLES WAS STABBED IN THE HEART IN A ROXBURY ALLEY BY A TEEN-AGE ACQUAINTANCE A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. <NOISE> SHE SAYS HER ANGER AND HER MEMORIES HAVE KEPT HER ALIVE. <NOISE> JOHNSON TENDS A SMALL TABLE IN HER APARTMENT <NOISE> WHICH SHE LOVINGLY CALLS CHARLES' STAND. <NOISE> ON IT SHE'S CAREFULLY ARRANGED RIBBONS FROM HIS FUNERAL WREATHS <NOISE> AND MANY OF HER SON'S FAVORITE THINGS.
JOHNSON WON'T LET THE OUTSIDE WORLD FORGET CHARLES EITHER. <NOISE> SHE'S A DEDICATED MEMBER OF PARENTS OF MURDERED CHILDREN, <NOISE> A GROUP WHOSE GROWING RANKS ARE PUSHING HARD FOR JUVENILES WHO COMMIT VIOLENT CRIMES <NOISE> TO BE TRIED AS ADULTS. <NOISE> TWENTY- SEVEN YEAR OLD MICHAEL FARROW SAYS AT FIRST HE CONSIDERED TAKING THE LAW INTO HIS OWN HANDS <NOISE> TO GET AT THE PEOPLE WHO RUINED HIS LIFE. <NOISE> THE FORMER CONSTRUCTION WORKER UNWITTINGLY WALKED INTO A GANG SHOOT-OUT NEAR A ROXBURY HOUSING PROJECT LAST AUGUST. <NOISE> HE LOST AN EYE. <NOISE> HE ALSO LOST HIS JOB, APARTMENT AND GIRLFRIEND. <NOISE> BUT FARROW SAYS NOW HE REALIZES TWO WRONGS DON'T MAKE A RIGHT. <NOISE> AND HE SAYS PERHAPS HIS PAIN SPARED SOMEONE ELSE.
ARE THOSE PICTURES OF HER ON THE ORGAN?
MOORE'S HELPING A SUPPORT GROUP GET OFF THE GROUND FOR PARENTS LIKE HERSELF. <NOISE> IT'S TOO BAD THERE ARE SO MANY MEMBERS SHE SAYS, <NOISE> BUT IT'S COMFORTING TO KNOW <NOISE> YOU ARE NOT ALONE. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
JONIE SAYS THE OLD WAYS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT. <NOISE> LIVING OFF THE LAND, SPECIAL CEREMONIES, RESPECTING ONE'S ELDERS AND BEING PART OF AN ENORMOUS EXTENDED FAMILY. <NOISE> SO LAST WINTER, AFTER GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS, <NOISE> SHE RE-ENROLLED IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL NEAR HER RESERVATION, <NOISE> BUT AFTER THREE DAYS OF CLASSES, <NOISE> SHE SAYS SHE REALIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING THE BEST EDUCATION POSSIBLE <NOISE> AND RETURNED TO NORTHFIELD MOUNT HERMAN.
IT'S NOTHING NEW FOR RESERVATION CHILDREN WHO ATTEND BOARDING SCHOOLS TO FEEL TORN <NOISE> BUT THERE'S NO COMPARISON BETWEEN TODAY'S PREP SCHOOLS, SAYS NORTHFIELD MOUNT HERMAN'S ADVISOR FOR NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS, TOM SORCEE, <NOISE> AND THE OLD MISSIONARY AND GOVERNMENT RUN BOARDING SCHOOLS <NOISE> WHERE CHILDREN WERE BEATEN FOR SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGES <NOISE> AND THE GOAL WAS TO CHRISTIANIZE OR AMERICANIZE THEM. <NOISE> SORCEE SAYS HIS GOAL IS TO PROVIDE A HOME AWAY FROM HOME <NOISE> AND APPARENTLY, HE'S SUCCEEDING. <NOISE> SORCEE SAYS DURING THE FIVE YEARS HE AND HIS WIFE, WHO IS NAVAJO, <NOISE> HAVE BEEN AT NORTHFIELD MOUNT HERMAN <NOISE> THE STUDENT BODY'S INCLUDED ABOUT A DOZEN NATIVE AMERICANS EACH YEAR AND ONLY ONE HAS DROPPED OUT.
THE NETWORK IS GROWING AS MORE AND MORE PREP SCHOOLS RECRUIT NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS. <NOISE> DOCTOR JOSEPH CURRY, HEADMASTER AT CUSHING ACADEMY IN ASHBURNHAM, MASSACHUSETTS, <NOISE> IS GREATLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TREND.
CURRY'S DETERMINED TO BUILD A TUITION-FREE PREP SCHOOL IN THE SOUTHWEST JUST FOR NATIVE AMERICANS. <NOISE> MEANWHILE, CUSHING ACADEMY SPONSORS A SIX- WEEK JUNIOR HIGH SUMMER SCHOOL THERE <NOISE> BASED ON THE PREP SCHOOL MODEL OF RIGOROUS ACADEMICS ALL DAY, <NOISE> STUDY HALL AT NIGHT, <NOISE> SPORTS AND FIELD TRIPS ON WEEKENDS. <NOISE> ENROLLMENT HAS GROWN FROM FIFTY STUDENTS IN NINETEEN- EIGHTY- EIGHT TO MORE THAN THREE- HUNDRED THIS SUMMER. <NOISE> CURRY SAYS MANY NATIVE AMERICAN FAMILIES, <NOISE> THRILLED TO SEE THEIR CHILDREN TURNED ON BY SCHOOL FOR A CHANGE, <NOISE> NOW WANT TO ENROLL THEM IN PREP SCHOOL YEAR-ROUND.

MORGAN STOPPED SHORT OF SAYING RACISM MAY UNDERLIE RECENT COMPLAINTS ABOUT METCO, PREFERRING INSTEAD TO SAY THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY BE INSENSITIVE TO THE IMPLICATIONS OF RACE. <NOISE> MORGAN'S NOT THE ONLY LINCOLNITE WHO'S CHOOSING WORDS CAREFULLY. <NOISE> IRENE RICE SAYS IT'S AS IF METCO'S A SACRED COW, <NOISE> WHICH FEW LINCOLN PARENTS HAVE DARED TO QUESTION PUBLICLY.
BUT DONALDSON SAYS WHAT MAY HAVE FORCED MOST METCO CRITICS OUT OF THE CLOSET <NOISE> IS THE STATEWIDE ECONOMICS SQUEEZE. <NOISE> THE STATE REIMBURSES LINCOLN FOR METCO RELATED COSTS, BUT THOSE FUNDS FACE A FIVE PERCENT CUT. <NOISE> MEANWHILE, LINCOLN ENROLLMENT IS RISING, <NOISE> REQUIRING TWO MORE CLASSROOMS NEXT YEAR. <NOISE> THAT EXPENSE AND OTHERS COULD BE AVOIDED, SOME TAXPAYERS SAY <NOISE> BY DOWNSIZING METCO. <NOISE> ESTIMATES VARY WIDELY ON HOW MUCH MONEY COULD BE SAVED. <NOISE> BUT NO MATTER WHAT THE COST, SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEMBER MICKEY LIPSEY SAYS YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON THE VALUE <NOISE> OF WELL- INTEGRATED CLASSROOMS.
CAROL STUART'S BROTHER, CARL DIMAITI, TOLD REPORTERS AND A CROWD OF ONLOOKERS, <NOISE> IT'S ONLY FITTING THAT WE'RE AT BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL IN MISSION HILL. <NOISE> THAT'S WHERE CAROL STUART AND HER HUSBAND ATTENDED A CHILDBIRTH CLASS LAST FALL, <NOISE> SHORTLY BEFORE CHARLES STUART APPARENTLY ORCHESTRATED HIS WIFE'S MURDER OUTSIDE A NEARBY HOUSING PROJECT. <NOISE> HE THEN BLAMED THE CRIME ON A BLACK MAN. <NOISE> IN AN EFFORT TO EASE THE RACIAL TENSIONS THAT ERUPTED <NOISE> AS WELL AS THEIR OWN PAIN, <NOISE> CAROL STUART'S FAMILY LAUNCHED A FOUNDATION TO PROVIDE COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIPS FOR MISSION HILL RESIDENTS <NOISE> AND TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS THAT COMBAT RACISM. <NOISE> STUART'S MOTHER, EVELYN DIMAITI, <NOISE> SAID SHE'S OVERWHELMED BY THE TALENTED PEOPLE WHO VOLUNTEERED FOR THE FOUNDATION'S BOARD.
BUT FIRST, THE TRUSTEES WILL REVIEW SCHOLARSHIP CANDIDATES. <NOISE> MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED IN JUST TWO WEEKS. <NOISE> DIMAITI SAYS AWARDS WILL BE MADE IN AUGUST. <NOISE> THE TRUSTEES ALSO HAVE SOME FUNDRAISING TO DO. <NOISE> ABOUT TEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS AND SEVERAL BUSINESSES HAVE MADE CONTRIBUTIONS, <NOISE> WITH THE LARGEST THUS FAR FROM BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL. <NOISE> THE FUND NOW TOTALS NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. <NOISE> BUT CARL DIMAITI SAYS ANOTHER HALF A MILLION IS NEEDED <NOISE> FOR THE CAROL DIMAITI STUART FOUNDATION <NOISE> TO BECOME A LASTING LEGACY. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
ACT UP BOSTON'S TARGETED NOT ONLY CARDINAL LAW, BUT MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL, <NOISE> HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, AND THE JOHN HANCOCK INSURANCE COMPANY IN THE PAST. <NOISE> ITS NEXT DEMONSTRATION, SAYS ONE ORGANIZER, <NOISE> IS LIKELY TO BE AT THE STATE HOUSE. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
ON ONE SIDE OF THE DEBATE BEFORE THE HEALTH CARE COMMITTEE ARE THOSE WHO CLAIM THAT RESIDENT PHYSICIANS NEED LEGAL PROTECTION. <NOISE> RESIDENTS ROUTINELY WORK NINETY TO ONE HUNDRED AND TEN HOURS PER WEEK. <NOISE> CAMBRIDGE HOSPITAL INTERN DAVID RAY <NOISE> APPLAUDS THE PROPOSAL TO CAP THE WORK WEEK AT SEVENTY- TWO HOURS.
AUTO INSURANCE WAS OVERHAULED LAST YEAR. NOW MOTORISTS ARE PAID DIRECTLY FOR REPAIR COSTS BASED ON AN INSURER'S APPRAISAL. <NOISE> CONSUMERS ARE REFERRED TO SEVERAL BODY SHOPS THAT WILL DO THE WORK FOR THAT AMOUNT, BUT ARE FREE TO SHOP AROUND. <NOISE> THE MASSACHUSETTS AUTO BODY ASSOCIATION <NOISE> SAYS THE LAW PROMOTES PRICE-FIXING BETWEEN INSURANCE COMPANIES AND SO-CALLED REFERRAL SHOPS <NOISE> AND IS PUTTING INDEPENDENTS OUT OF BUSINESS, <NOISE> BUT CONSUMER ATTORNEY FOR THE MASSACHUSETTS PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP, JOSH CRADKA, <NOISE> SAYS INDEPENDENTS ARE TRYING TO CHIP AWAY AT AUTO INSURANCE REFORM.
THE AUTO BODY ASSOCIATION WANTS TO LIMIT THE KINDS OF SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS A REFERRAL SHOP MAY RECEIVE. <NOISE> CRADKA SAYS THAT WILL DISCOURAGE ANY SHOP FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE REFERRAL SYSTEM. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
THE CITY'S CONTRACT WITH SOME TWO- HUNDRED AND SEVENTY B.C.H. RESIDENT PHYSICIANS EXPIRES JUNE THIRTIETH. <NOISE> IT GUARANTEES SUPPORT STAFF. A NEW PROPOSAL DOES NOT. <NOISE> DOCTOR MARIA PATERO HEADS THE RESIDENCE UNION. <NOISE> SHE SAYS PHYSICIANS IN TRAINING WORK NINETY TO ONE- HUNDRED AND TWENTY HOURS PER WEEK <NOISE> AND WON'T SETTLE FOR A CONTRACT THAT DOES NOT PROMISE ANCILLARY SERVICES.
PATERO SAYS THE CITY MUST FIND THE MONEY TO PROVIDE RESIDENTS WITH BASIC SUPPORT <NOISE> BUT NEARLY EIGHTY B.C.H., MATTAPAN, AND LONG ISLAND HOSPITAL WORKERS <NOISE> RECEIVED PINK SLIPS LAST WEEK AND CITY OFFICIALS SAY NEXT YEAR'S BARE BONES BUDGET <NOISE> WILL NECESSITATE MORE LAYOFFS. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
ACCORDING TO UNICEF, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL MONITORING GROUPS, <NOISE> ONE OF EVERY THREE PEOPLE WHO DIE EACH DAY IS A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE. <NOISE> EACH AND EVERY DAY PREVENTABLE DISEASES SUCH AS TETANUS AND MEASLES <NOISE> KILL ALMOST EIGHT THOUSAND CHILDREN. <NOISE> DEHYDRATION, KILLS NEARLY SEVEN- THOUSAND, <NOISE> PNEUMONIA, MORE THAN SIX- THOUSAND. AT PRESENT RATES, ALMOST ONE- HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION CHILDREN WILL DIE DURING THE NINETEEN- NINETIES. <NOISE> THE STATISTICS, IN SHORT, ARE STAGGERING.
ALEX PALACIOS IS UNICEF'S WASHINGTON LOBBYIST. <NOISE> HE AND OTHER CHILD ADVOCATES YESTERDAY <NOISE> CALLED ON PRESIDENT BUSH TO SIGN THE CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD. <NOISE> THE TREATY'S ON THE AGENDA FOR THIS WEEKEND'S WORLD SUMMIT FOR CHILDREN AT THE U.N.. <NOISE> PALACIOS SAYS HE'S RECEIVED INFORMAL WORD FROM THE WHITE HOUSE <NOISE> THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL SIGN THE DOCUMENT SUNDAY, <NOISE> BUT IT'S UNCLEAR IF BUSH WILL PUSH HARD FOR SENATE RATIFICATION. <NOISE> CALLING THE TREATY THE MAGNA CARTA FOR CHILDREN, <NOISE> PALACIOS SAYS SPEEDY APPROVAL IS CRITICAL. <NOISE> HE ADMITS, THE TREATY ALONE WON'T CHANGE CHILDREN'S LIVES, <NOISE> BUT SAYS IT CAN CHANGE ATTITUDES AND POLICIES <NOISE> ABOUT CHILDREN'S NEEDS AND RIGHTS.
PALACIOS SAYS THE TREATY ALSO CAN ADD MUSCLE TO THE ARGUMENT <NOISE> THAT GOVERNMENTS MUST RE-ARRANGE PRIORITIES AND RESOURCES TO PUT CHILDREN FIRST, NOT LAST ON THE LIST. <NOISE> TUFTS UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT, JEAN MEYERE, <NOISE> MAKES THAT POINT WITH HIS OWN STATISTICS.
MEYERE SAYS EVERY CHIEF OF STATE WILL PROFESS HIS OR HER LOVE FOR CHILDREN <NOISE> BUT THEIR BUDGETS PRIMARILY REFLECT A LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE ARMS RACE. <NOISE> ACCORDING TO UNICEF, <NOISE> TWENTY- THOUSAND OF THE FORTY- THOUSAND CHILDREN WHO DIE EACH DAY <NOISE> COULD BE SAVED BY EXPANDING IMMUNIZATION AND NUTRITION PROGRAMS <NOISE> AT A COST OF TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. <NOISE> THE SAME AMOUNT, SAYS UNICEF, <NOISE> THAT THE WORLDS NATIONS SPEND ON WEAPONS EACH DAY. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY- FOUR JIM GRILSH WAS A HEALTHY FATHER OF TWO WORKING FOR BOSTON EDISON <NOISE> WHEN SUDDENLY, AT THE AGE OF THIRTY- SEVEN, <NOISE> HE LOST HIS HEARING OVERNIGHT. <NOISE> TO THIS DAY DOCTORS DON'T KNOW WHY. <NOISE> LIKE OTHER LATE DEAFENED ADULTS, <NOISE> GRILSH'S LOSS ISOLATED HIM. <NOISE> HE DOESN'T IDENTIFY WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE BORN DEAF, WHO HAVE CREATED THEIR OWN COMMUNITY AND LANGUAGE. <NOISE> GRILSH SAYS HE'S A PRODUCT OF THE HEARING WORLD <NOISE> AND IT'S FRUSTRATING TO NO LONGER BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE FULLY. <NOISE> GRILSH HASN'T LEARNED SIGN LANGUAGE BECAUSE EVERYONE HE KNOWS CAN HEAR. <NOISE> HE TRIES TO READ LIPS, WHICH IS DIFFICULT AT BEST, <NOISE> AND HAS HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS COMMUNICATE WITH HIM IN WRITING.
GERTNER SAYS THE STATE SUPREME COURT'S RULING INVOLVED THE CASE OF A THIRD PARTY WHOSE CAR HIT A PREGNANT PEDESTRIAN, KILLING HER FETUS. <NOISE> BUT ACCORDING TO GERTNER, <NOISE> THE HIGH COURT SAID NOTHING ABOUT PROSECUTING A WOMAN FOR HARMING HER OWN FETUS. <NOISE> IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE TO CHARGE LEVY WITH DRUNK DRIVING, SAYS GERTNER, <NOISE> BUT IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO ALSO CHARGE HER <NOISE> WITH KILLING PART OF HER OWN BODY.
DIRECTOR OF THE MASSACHUSETTS CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION JOHN ROBERTS <NOISE> WANTS HARSHBARGER TO DROP THE HOMICIDE CHARGE AGAINST LEVY. <NOISE> THE CASE IS PART OF AN ALARMING TREND, HE SAYS, <NOISE> TO PIT SO-CALLED FETAL RIGHTS AGAINST WOMEN'S RIGHTS TO PRIVACY AND AUTONOMY.
BUT HARSHBARGER SAYS <NOISE> THERE'S NO THREAT THAT PREGNANT WOMEN WILL BE PROSECUTED FOR LEGAL CONDUCT <NOISE> EVEN IF HARM TO A FETUS RESULTS. <NOISE> MARIAN STOKES AGREES, SAYING THAT AFTER ALL DRUNK DRIVING IS AGAINST THE LAW. <NOISE> THE CO-FOUNDER OF THE GREATER BOSTON CHAPTER OF MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING, <NOISE> SAYS SHE EMPATHIZES WITH THE PAIN ELIZABETH LEVY MUST BE FEELING OVER HER LOSS, <NOISE> BUT SHE SAYS THAT'S NO REASON TO TREAT LEVY DIFFERENTLY <NOISE> THAN THE DRUNK DRIVER WHO KILLED STOKES' SON.
IF THE MOTOR VEHICLE HOMICIDE CHARGE STICKS AND LEVY IS CONVICTED, <NOISE> SHE FACES ONE TO FIFTEEN YEARS IN PRISON. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
AT A CANDIDATE'S FORUM LAST AUGUST AND IN A SUBSEQUENT MEETING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS, <NOISE> JOHN SILBER SUGGESTED THERE'S NO NEED TO COMPLETELY RULE OUT FURTHER DEVELOPMENT ON WETLANDS, <NOISE> BECAUSE BEAVERS CAN ALWAYS CREATE NEW HABITAT. <NOISE> LATER SILBER SAID HE WAS JOKING. <NOISE> ENVIRONMENTALISTS, RECALLING THE BEAVER REMARK AND A DESCRIPTION ONCE COINED BY SILBER OF BOSTON UNIVERSITY'S ENGLISH DEPARTMENT, <NOISE> NOW HAVE A JOKE OF THEIR OWN. <NOISE> WHAT DO YOU CALL A BEAVER WHO BUILDS HER DWELLING? <NOISE> A DAM MATRIARCH. <NOISE> BUT SILBER'S ENVIRONMENTAL PLATFORM IS NO LAUGHING MATTER, SAYS CAROLINE SIMMONS, <NOISE> DIRECTOR OF THE MASSACHUSETTS ASSOCIATION OF CONSERVATION COMMISSIONS, <NOISE> HER VOICE MUFFLED BY A BUCKTOOTHED BEAVER MASK.
DRESSED AS BEULAH BEAVER, SIMMONS APPEARED AT YESTERDAY'S ENDORSEMENT OF REPUBLICAN WILLIAM WELD BY THE SIERRA CLUB, AND THE LEAGUE OF ENVIRONMENTAL VOTERS. <NOISE> WELD SUPPORTERS TOUTED SEVERAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION CASES <NOISE> CHAMPIONED BY THE FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY. <NOISE> THEY ALSO COMPARED WELD'S ENVIRONMENTAL PROMISES IF HE'S ELECTED GOVERNOR <NOISE> WITH JOHN SILBER'S. WELD SUPPORTS STRICTER AUTO EMISSION STANDARDS THAN NATIONAL NORMS. <NOISE> SILBER THINKS FEDERAL STANDARDS SHOULD PREVAIL <NOISE> OR ELSE BUSINESSES MAY BE DRIVEN FROM THE STATE. <NOISE> WELD APPLAUDS MANDATORY RECYCLING, <NOISE> SILBER DISMISSES RECYCLING GOALS AS MEANINGLESS. <NOISE> WELD SUPPORTS CONSTRUCTION OF A SECONDARY TREATMENT PLANT FOR BOSTON HARBOR, <NOISE> SILBER THINKS THERE MAY BE A LESS EXPENSIVE, BUT JUST AS EFFECTIVE, ALTERNATIVE. PRISCILLA CHAPMAN, DIRECTOR OF THE SIERRA CLUB'S NEW ENGLAND CHAPTER, <NOISE> SAYS, ENVIRONMENTALLY MINDED VOTERS HAVE A CLEAR CHOICE.
ANOTHER SIERRA CLUB SPOKESWOMAN <NOISE> SAYS WELD WILL LISTEN TO BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY BEFORE MAKING A JUDGMENT, <NOISE> BUT SHE DOESN'T GET THAT FEELING FROM SILBER. <NOISE> BUT WHILE WELD MAY BE LONG ON PEOPLE SKILLS, <NOISE> HE MAY BE SHORT ON MONEY TO IMPLEMENT HIS PROPOSALS. <NOISE> WELD SUPPORTS THE C.L.T. TAX ROLL BACK PETITION, <NOISE> UNLIKE THOSE WHO ENDORSED HIM YESTERDAY WHO ARE WORKING TO DEFEAT QUESTION THREE. <NOISE> BUT EVEN IF THE ROLL BACK PASSES, <NOISE> THEY STILL SAY THEY'D RATHER SEE WELD IN THE CORNER OFFICE, THAN SILBER. <NOISE> WHEN TOLD OF THE ENDORSEMENT, <NOISE> SILBER SAID ENVIRONMENTALISTS PICKED THE WRONG MAN.
SEVERAL PROMINENT DEMOCRATS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT, INCLUDING FORMER U.S. SENATOR PAUL TSONGAS WHO ARE BACKING SILBER, AGREE. <NOISE> ATTORNEY DOUGLAS MCDONALD, A SPECIALIST IN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, <NOISE> SAYS SILBER'S GOT HIS VOTE BECAUSE OF HIS ANTI-C.L.T. STANCE. MCDONALD ALSO APPRECIATES WHAT HE CALLS SILBER'S ENVIRONMENTAL PRAGMATISM, <NOISE> AND SAYS THE QUOTE <NOISE> BEAVER THING WAS UNFORTUNATE.
BUT WELD'S ENDORSERS SAY SILBER'S INVOLVED IN A MASQUERADE. <NOISE> BEING AGAINST C.L.T. THEY SAY, <NOISE> DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY MAKE SILBER PRO-ENVIRONMENT. <NOISE> THEY SAY THE ONLY TRUE ENVIRONMENTALIST IN THE GUBERNATORIAL RACE <NOISE> IS WILLIAM WELD. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
LIKE MANY ROCKPORT RESIDENTS, MARTHA WOODWORTH IS FURIOUS WITH THE SMITHSONIAN. <NOISE> WOODWORTH AN ASTROLOGER AND PSYCHIC, <NOISE> SAYS SHE HASN'T BEEN IN TOUCH WITH FRANS DENGHAUSEN, A LONGTIME ROCKPORT ARTIST WHO DIED THREE YEARS AGO. <NOISE> BUT SHE'S CERTAIN DENGHAUSEN WOULD BE FURIOUS TOO. <NOISE> AT ISSUE IS A CODICIL TO HIS WILL, <NOISE> BEQUEATHING ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO ROCKPORT TO REPLACE IT'S OBSOLETE PUBLIC LIBRARY, <NOISE> PROVIDED THE TOWN CONTRIBUTES LAND FOR A NEW BUILDING, <NOISE> OR FUNDS TO RENOVATE AN EXISTING STRUCTURE. <NOISE> THE SMITHSONIAN, THE BENEFICIARY OF THE BULK OF DENGHAUSEN'S ESTATE <NOISE> CLAIMS THE BEQUEST CAN BE USED ONLY FOR LIBRARY OPERATING COSTS, <NOISE> ONCE ROCKPORT USES IT'S OWN MONEY FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. <NOISE> IF ROCKPORT DOES NOT INHERIT THE MILLION DOLLARS, <NOISE> THE SMITHSONIAN AS RESIDUAL BENEFICIARY WILL. <NOISE> ADMITTEDLY THE CODICIL IS CONFUSING, <NOISE> BUT DENGHAUSEN'S FRIEND AND FORMER LIBRARY TRUSTEE, ANNE FISK, <NOISE> SAYS IN SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS BEFORE HIS UNTIMELY DEATH, <NOISE> DENGHAUSEN INDICATED HE WANTED THE MONEY TO BE SPENT ON CONVERTING A NOW CLOSED SCHOOL INTO THE NEW LIBRARY.
TOWN OFFICIALS SAY, GIVEN THAT ROCKPORT'S ALREADY HEAVILY IN DEBT TO PAY FOR A NEW SCHOOL COMPLEX, <NOISE> THERE'S NO NEW LIBRARY IN SIGHT UNLESS DENGHAUSEN'S MONEY CAN BE USED FOR CONSTRUCTION. <NOISE> THE PRESENT LIBRARY OPENED IN NINETEEN- OH- SIX, <NOISE> DIRECTOR, STEVEN RASK, APOLOGIZES FOR PILES OF BOOKS ON THE FLOOR, <NOISE> SAYING THERE'S NO MORE ROOM ON THE SHELVES. <NOISE> IF ALLOWED TO MOVE TO THE FORMER SCHOOL HOUSE, <NOISE> RASK SAYS THE LIBRARY COULD ACCOMMODATE NEARLY THREE TIMES AS MANY VOLUMES, <NOISE> AN EXPANDED CHILDREN'S ROOM, A COMMUNITY MEETING HALL <NOISE> AND A READING ROOM NAMED AFTER ITS BENEFACTOR. <NOISE> NOW THERE'S NO PLACE TO READ, SAYS RASK, <NOISE> EXCEPT FOR A FEW CHAIRS SQUEEZED INTO CORNERS.
SMITHSONIAN SPOKESPERSON, MADELEINE JACOBS, <NOISE> INSISTS THE INSTITUTION'S NOT BEING GREEDY. <NOISE> THE SMITHSONIAN ALREADY INHERITED NEARLY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FROM MRS. DENGHAUSEN WHO DIED A YEAR BEFORE HER HUSBAND. <NOISE> IT'S DUE FOUR TO FIVE MILLION MORE ONCE MISTER DENGHAUSEN'S ESTATE IS SETTLED. <NOISE> BEING ENTRUSTED WITH MOST OF THE COUPLE'S FORTUNE, SAYS JACOBS, <NOISE> GIVES THE SMITHSONIAN A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT NONE OF IT'S MISSPENT.
ROCKPORT RESIDENTS FIND THAT ARGUMENT ESPECIALLY GALLING, <NOISE> SAYING TO THE SMITHSONIAN, DENGHAUSEN'S NOTHING MORE THAN A GENEROUS STRANGER. <NOISE> THE CASE WILL BE HEARD IN ESSEX'S PROBATE COURT AUGUST FIFTEENTH, <NOISE> MEANWHILE SEVERAL OF ROCKPORT'S WELL CONNECTED CITIZENS <NOISE> ARE CANCELLING THEIR SMITHSONIAN MEMBERSHIPS AND LOBBYING POLITICIANS TO THROW THEIR WEIGHT BEHIND THE TOWN. <NOISE> IF ROCKPORT PREVAILS, <NOISE> THE SMITHSONIAN'S JACOBS SAYS THE INSTITUTION'S LIKELY TO LET THE MATTER <NOISE> REST IN PEACE. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
GRAFTON RESIDENTS SAY THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN <NOISE> EVEN BEFORE THE MATERIAL GETS TO THE PLANT. <NOISE> EN ROUTE ASBESTOS FILLED TRUCKS WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE THROUGH RESIDENTIAL AREAS. <NOISE> ONLY ONE ACCIDENT, SAYS THE TOWN'S PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE, <NOISE> COULD SUBJECT COUNTLESS HOMES TO AN ASBESTOS SHOWER. <NOISE> TOWN PLANNER, PETER LOWETT, SAYS MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE IF THAT FEAR IS WELL-FOUNDED. <NOISE> MEANWHILE, HE SAYS TOWN OFFICIALS WILL NOT RUBBER-STAMP THE PROJECT <NOISE> EVEN THOUGH GRAFTON COULD CERTAINLY USE THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT'S BEEN PROMISED.
BEYOND TOWN ZONING AND PUBLIC HEALTH BOARD'S REVIEW <NOISE> A STATE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT IS LIKELY TO BE REQUIRED. <NOISE> DEVELOPER, RAYMOND MARSHALL, SAYS IF THE PERMITTING PROCESS DRAGS ON, <NOISE> HE'LL TAKE HIS BUSINESS OUT OF STATE. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY-SIX, DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR MICHAEL DUKAKIS FULFILLED A CAMPAIGN PROMISE TO DE-POLITICIZE JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS. <NOISE> HE NAMED REPUBLICAN EDWARD HENNESSY TO HEAD THE STATE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT. <NOISE> FOR HENNESSY, IT WAS ANOTHER STEP ALONG A DISTINGUISHED CAREER THAT BEGAN AS A TRIAL LAWYER AND LED TO AN APPOINTMENT AS AN ASSOCIATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY-ONE. <NOISE> THAT YEAR THOMAS MAFFY, NOW PRESIDENT OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BAR ASSOCIATION, WAS HENNESSY'S LAW CLERK.
THE DEVICE IS ATTACHED TO A PLASTIC WRISTBAND. IT LOOKS LIKE A WATCH. IT FUNCTIONS LIKE AN ELECTRONIC PROBATION OFFICER. <NOISE> WHEN A COMPUTERIZED CALL IS MADE TO A FORMER PRISONER'S HOME PHONE, <NOISE> THAT PERSON ANSWERS BY PLUGGING IN THE DEVICE. <NOISE> THE WRISTBAND CAN BE REMOVED ONLY BY BREAKING ITS CLASP, AND IF THAT'S DONE THE INMATE IS IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO JAIL. <NOISE> THE DESCRIPTION CONJURES UP IMAGES OF BIG BROTHER WATCHING. BUT JAY ASH, DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF THE HAMPTON COUNTY JAIL IN SPRINGFIELD, <NOISE> SAYS THE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM IS NOT THAT SINISTER.
ROSENBLATT EXPECTS ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE IN PAROLE SITUATIONS TO BECOME MORE WIDE SPREAD, AND HE THINKS EVENTUALLY <NOISE> PEOPLE WILL GET USED TO THE IDEA. <NOISE> SPRINGFIELD JAIL DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT ASH SAYS ALTHOUGH IT WILL ALLOW SOME PRISONERS TO BE RELEASED A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THEIR SENTENCES ARE UP, <NOISE> CONCERNS THAT MAY RAISE ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY ARE NOT WELL FOUNDED. <NOISE> MOST COUNTY JAIL INMATES DID NOT COMMIT VIOLENT CRIMES. THEY'RE IN JAIL FOR SUCH THINGS AS BAD CHECKS OR STEALING. <NOISE> THOSE ON EARLY RELEASE MUST CHECK IN WITH CORRECTIONS OFFICIALS FIFTY TIMES A WEEK ACCORDING TO ASH, <NOISE> WHO SAYS ABOUT HALF THE CONTACTS FOR A SELECT GROUP WILL NOW BE MADE BY THE COMPUTERIZED PHONE CALLS. <NOISE> INITIALLY THE PROGRAM WILL INVOLVE ONLY A HANDFUL OF INMATES. <NOISE> ASH SAYS THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO USE IT TO GET ABOUT FORTY OUT OF JAIL EARLY. <NOISE> THE SPRINGFIELD JAIL, BUILT FOR TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY PEOPLE, <NOISE> NOW HOUSES MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
AND IN FACT THE STATE IS NOT PLANNING ON PUTTING MORE POLICE ON THE ROAD. STATE OFFICIALS SAY THERE WILL BE THE SAME LEVELS OF ENFORCEMENT. <NOISE> B.U.'S PROFESSOR HENKSEN BELIEVES THE KEY TO THE NEW LAW'S SUCCESS IS ITS ENFORCEMENT.
FORD AND OTHER OPPONENTS OF THE PER SE CLAUSE SAY IT RELIES EXCLUSIVELY ON THE BREATH TEST, AND THEY SAY BREATHALIZERS ARE SIMPLY UNRELIABLE. <NOISE> JOHN TARANTINO IS A PROVIDENCE ATTORNEY WHO SPECIALIZES IN DRUNKEN DRIVING CASES.
WHEN CLASSES RESUME AT WHEATON COLLEGE TOMORROW, THE FORMER ALL WOMEN'S SCHOOL WILL GET ITS SECOND INFLUX OF MALE STUDENTS. <NOISE> ONE HUNDRED NINETY-FIVE OF THIS YEAR'S TWELVE-HUNDRED STUDENTS WILL BE MEN, THAT'S UP SEVENTY-FIVE FROM LAST YEAR, <NOISE> AND AS YEAR NUMBER TWO OF CO-EDUCATION AT WHEATON GETS UNDERWAY, <NOISE> TWO PROFESSORS HAVE BEEN STUDYING THE IMPACT OF YEAR NUMBER ONE, TO SEE HOW MEN HAVE CHANGED THE WHEATON CLASSROOM. <NOISE> WBUR'S ANDY BOWERS REPORTS.
THIS IS WBUR'S MORNING EDITION, I'M LISA MULLINS. AFTER TEN YEARS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AT A COST OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS, <NOISE> THE GILLETTE COMPANY OF BOSTON HAS LIFTED THE SHROUD OF SECRECY FROM ITS NEWEST RAZOR. <NOISE> IT'S CALLED "SENSOR", AND IT WAS INTRODUCED YESTERDAY AROUND THE WORLD, PART OF A NINETEEN COUNTRY, ONE HUNDRED TEN MILLION DOLLAR MARKETING CAMPAIGN. <NOISE> IS IT WORTH THE HYPE? <NOISE> WBUR'S BRUCE GELLERMAN TOOK AN ADVANCE COPY OF SENSOR OUT FOR A TEST SHAVE, <NOISE> AND FILES THIS REPORT.
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN MASSACHUSETTS MAY AFFECT FUTURE TRAFFIC PROBLEMS IN BOSTON. <NOISE> IT SEEMS THERE'S GROWING SENTIMENT AMONG STATE SENATORS TO SLOW DOWN THE MULTIBILLION DOLLAR CENTRAL ARTERY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. <NOISE> WBUR'S ANDREW CAFFREY REPORTS.
THERE WERE OTHER SIGNS OF THE STATE'S BUDGET BLUES THIS WEEK. <NOISE> THE COMMUNITY SANITATION DIVISION WAS DECIMATED AS FOLLOWS: <NOISE> THE FOOD AND DRUG DIVISION LOST THREE INSPECTOR POSITIONS, HEALTH CARE QUALITY LOST SEVEN. <NOISE> THE NUMBERS SEEM TO BE SMALL, BUT DAMAGE TO STATE AND LOCAL EFFORTS TO ENSURE THE QUALITY OF FOOD, MEDICAL CARE, <NOISE> AND RENTAL HOUSING IS EXPECTED TO BE GREAT. <NOISE> WBUR'S MARGO MELNICOVE REPORTS.
THIS IS WBUR'S MORNING EDITION, I'M LISA MULLINS. IN THE MASSACHUSETTS HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AN UPSET VICTORY FOR HEALTH CARE ADVOCATES. THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP YESTERDAY <NOISE> DEFEATED EFFORTS TO REPEAL KEY PROVISIONS OF THE UNIVERSAL HEALTH INSURANCE LAW. <NOISE> WBUR'S ANDY CAFFREY REPORTS.
IN WASHINGTON D.C. YESTERDAY, CHINESE STUDENTS MARKED THE FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR COUNTRY'S COMMUNIST REVOLUTION <NOISE> WITH A DEMONSTRATION IN SUPPORT OF THE PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT.
SOME FIFTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS MARCHED FROM THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL TO THE CHINESE EMBASSY. ORGANIZERS SAY THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE BUT MANY STUDENTS STAYED AWAY, <NOISE> FEARFUL THAT THEIR ACTIVISM IN AMERICA COULD MEAN REPRESSION OF THEIR FAMILIES BACK HOME IN CHINA. <NOISE> BECAUSE OF SUCH FEARS, MANY CHINESE STUDENTS SAY THEY WILL STAY IN THE WEST UNTIL THE SITUATION AT HOME IMPROVES. <NOISE> BUT AS WBUR'S ANDY BOWERS REPORTS, THEY MAY HAVE A LONG WAIT AHEAD OF THEM.
WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW WON'T HURT YOU. THAT ADAGE MAY APPLY TO MOST SITUATIONS BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ILLEGAL DRUGS, <NOISE> BOSTON OFFICIALS SAY KNOWLEDGE IS POWER. <NOISE> MAYOR RAY FLYNN CALLED UPON POLICE, SCHOOL, CHURCH, AND CIVIC LEADERS RECENTLY TO WAGE AN ALL-OUT INFORMATIONAL CAMPAIGN ON ICE, <NOISE> A NEW DRUG THAT'S EXPECTED TO SHOW UP IN BOSTON SOON. <NOISE> AUTHORITIES SAY ICE IS PERHAPS THE MOST DANGEROUS DRUG EVER TO HIT THE STREETS. <NOISE> WBUR'S MARGO MELNICOVE REPORTS.
THIS LAST YOUNG MOTHER-TO-BE IS LUCKIER THAN MANY. <NOISE> SHE AND THE FATHER OF HER CHILD ARE MARRIED AND ARE PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE, AND EVEN THOUGH SHE'S BEEN SEXUALLY ACTIVE SINCE SHE WAS TWELVE, <NOISE> SHE AVOIDED UNWANTED PREGNANCIES BY USING BIRTH CONTROL PILLS THAT HER MOTHER HELPED HER GET AT A LOCAL HOSPITAL. <NOISE> THESE THREE YOUNG WOMEN LIKE THE IDEA OF SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH CLINICS. <NOISE> IF ONE HAD EXISTED IN THEIR SCHOOLS, THEY SAY THEY WOULD HAVE USED IT FOR SOMEONE TO TALK TO ABOUT SEX AND FOR A SAFE PLACE TO GET BIRTH CONTROL. <NOISE> A PILOT PROJECT TO SET UP SUCH CLINICS IN TWO TO FOUR BOSTON MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS WAS PROPOSED LAST SPRING BY THE BOSTON STUDENT HUMAN SERVICES COLLABORATIVE. <NOISE> THE PLAN WAS ENDORSED LAST FALL BY THE ADOLESCENT ISSUES TASK FORCE SET UP BY THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. <NOISE> TASK FORCE MEMBER MARY CONROY, WHO DIRECTS FAMILY LIFE EDUCATION AT SAINT MARGARET'S, <NOISE> WAS ONE OF A FEW DISSENTING VOTES AGAINST THE ENDORSEMENT.
THESE CLAIMS ARE DISPUTED BY THE HEAD OF THE TASK FORCE, DOCTOR DEBORAH PROTHROW-STITH. SHE SAYS SINCE STUDENTS DON'T USE EXISTING SERVICES, <NOISE> SCHOOL-BASED CLINICS WOULD BE AN ALTERNATIVE RATHER THAN A DUPLICATION. <NOISE> AND SHE SAYS, LIKE HEALTH CARE IN THE WORK PLACE, THE THRUST OF HEALTH CARE IN THE SCHOOLS IS TO OVERCOME ACCESS BARRIERS.
PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSAL TO SET UP HEALTH CLINICS IN SCHOOLS ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO MULTIPLY, IF SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS LAVAL WILSON GOES ALONG WITH THE IDEA NEXT MONTH. <NOISE> THE BOSTON SCHOOL COMMITTEE, RELIGIOUS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS <NOISE> HAVE ALREADY COME TO LOGGERHEADS OVER THE ISSUE. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
ATTORNEY HASKEL KASSLER CHAIRS THE JUDICIAL NOMINATING COUNCIL, <NOISE> EIGHTEEN ATTORNEYS AND LAYPEOPLE CHARGED WITH SCREENING APPLICANTS FOR VACANCIES ON THE BENCH. <NOISE> USUALLY THE J.N.C. REFERS THREE NOMINEES TO THE GOVERNOR. <NOISE> HIS TOP CHOICE IS RATED BY BAR ASSOCIATIONS AND GRILLED BY THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE COUNCIL. <NOISE> KASSLER SAYS, UNLIKE THE FEDERAL SUPREME COURT, <NOISE> THERE'S NO LITMUS TEST ON PARTICULAR ISSUES THAT MASSACHUSETTS HIGH COURT NOMINEES MUST PASS.
ALL BUT ONE OF THE CHIEF JUSTICES SINCE EIGHTEEN NINETY- NINE, WHEN OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES WAS APPOINTED, <NOISE> CAME FROM THE RANKS OF S.J.C. ASSOCIATE JUDGES. <NOISE> IF HE STICKS WITH TRADITION, DUKAKIS IS LIKELY TO ELEVATE ONE OF HIS APPOINTEES TO CHIEF. <NOISE> THAT MEANS PAUL LEOCOS OR RUTH ABRAMS, THE ONLY WOMAN ON THE COURT. <NOISE> ANOTHER POSSIBLE CHOICE IS HERBERT WILKINS, A GOVERNOR SARGENT APPOINTEE, <NOISE> AND NEXT TO HENNESSY, THE COURT'S MOST SENIOR MEMBER. <NOISE> THE OTHER THREE ASSOCIATE JUSTICES WERE PUT ON THE BENCH BY GOVERNOR EDWARD KING. <NOISE> AND MANY LAWYERS SAY THAT DESPITE DUKAKIS' PROMISE TO KEEP THE JUDICIARY ABOVE THE POLITICAL FRAY, <NOISE> IT'S UNLIKELY DUKAKIS WILL CHOOSE A KING APPOINTEE TO RUN THE STATE'S HIGHEST COURT. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
THE DEVICE IS ATTACHED TO A PLASTIC WRISTBAND. IT LOOKS LIKE A WATCH. IT FUNCTIONS LIKE AN ELECTRONIC PROBATION OFFICER. <NOISE> WHEN A COMPUTERIZED CALL IS MADE TO A FORMER PRISONER'S HOME PHONE, <NOISE> THAT PERSON ANSWERS BY PLUGGING IN THE DEVICE. <NOISE> THE WRISTBAND CAN BE REMOVED ONLY BY BREAKING ITS CLASP, <NOISE> AND IF THAT'S DONE THE INMATE IS IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO JAIL. <NOISE> THE DESCRIPTION CONJURES UP IMAGES OF BIG BROTHER WATCHING. <NOISE> BUT JAY ASH, DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF THE HAMPTON COUNTY JAIL IN SPRINGFIELD, <NOISE> SAYS THE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM IS NOT THAT SINISTER.
SUCH SUPERVISION, ACCORDING TO ASH, IS A SENSIBLE, COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION THAT SHOULD NOT ALARM CIVIL LIBERTARIANS. <NOISE> DOCTOR NORMAN ROSENBLATT, DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE AT NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY, AGREES.
MAYOR HASTENS TO POINT OUT THAT FOUR RANDOMLY SELECTED CLASSES DON'T NECESSARILY REPRESENT ALL OTHERS, <NOISE> BUT THE TREND WAS UNDENIABLE. <NOISE> MAYOR WORKED ON THE STUDY WITH CATHERINE KRUPNIK, A LECTURER AT HARVARD'S GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION. <NOISE> KRUPNIK CONDUCTED A SIMILAR STUDY AT HARVARD WITH SIMILAR RESULTS, <NOISE> BUT FOUND ONE BIG DIFFERENCE AT WHEATON.
MAYOR AND KRUPNIK PLAN TO CONTINUE THEIR RESEARCH THIS YEAR ON THE EFFECTS OF COEDUCATION IN THE CLASSROOMS OF WHEATON.
CHUNG YU AND HIS COLLEAGUE CHAU FONG WONG WORK ON CANCER RESEARCH AT M.I.T. <NOISE> THEY'D LIKE TO CONTINUE THEIR WORK IN CHINA, <NOISE> BUT BOTH SPENT YEARS LABORING IN THE CHINESE COUNTRYSIDE DURING THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION <NOISE> AND REFUSE TO GO BACK IF THEY FACE ANOTHER GOVERNMENT CRACKDOWN. <NOISE> CHAU FONG WONG:
BOTH WONG AND YU ARE NOW LEARNING A NEW SKILL: <NOISE> HOW TO MOVE THE AMERICAN LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. <NOISE> THEY'VE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF EFFORTS BY CHINESE STUDENTS TO CHANGE THEIR U.S. VISA STATUS. <NOISE> CURRENTLY, EIGHTY PERCENT OF CHINESE STUDENTS HOLD SO-CALLED J VISAS <NOISE> WHICH REQUIRE THEM TO RETURN TO CHINA FOR TWO YEARS BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN APPLY FOR U.S. RESIDENCY. <NOISE> DIFFERING BILLS TO WAVE THE TWO YEAR RULE HAVE PASSED THE SENATE AND HOUSE <NOISE> AND ARE ON THEIR WAY TO A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. <NOISE> BUT TIME IS CRITICAL BECAUSE THERE MAY BE SEVERAL THOUSAND STUDENTS WHOSE VISAS HAVE ALREADY EXPIRED. <NOISE> MOST OF THOSE HAVE NOT SIGNED UP FOR THE ONE YEAR EXTENSION GRANTED BY PRESIDENT BUSH IN JUNE <NOISE> BECAUSE THAT MEASURE REQUIRES THEM TO RETURN TO CHINA AT THE END OF THE YEAR. <NOISE> ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE TO SEEK POLITICAL ASYLUM, <NOISE> BUT CHOU FONG WONG SAYS THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS AS WELL.
STUDENTS IN THE U.S. DO HAVE OTHER OPTIONS. <NOISE> CANADA AND SEVERAL EUROPEAN NATIONS HAVE BEEN QUICKER TO GRANT THEM RESIDENCY <NOISE> AND SINGAPORE AND TAIWAN ARE ACTIVELY RECRUITING THEM. <NOISE> BUT NO MATTER WHAT, MOST SAY THEY'RE DETERMINED NOT TO GO BACK HOME, <NOISE> AT LEAST NOT YET.
A GUY WHO LOVES KIDS, WANTED TO SAVE MONEY FOR COLLEGE AND WASN'T CRAZY ABOUT HIS OTHER OPTIONS AFTER HE GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL IN WESTFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS.
THESE DAYS HAMLIN SAYS, SHE'S TURNING AWAY APPLICANTS.
HILL'S VERSION WAS PRODUCED IN LONDON TWO YEARS BEFORE WEBBER'S <NOISE> ALTHOUGH THE LATER RECEIVED THE LION'S SHARE OF ATTENTION. <NOISE> BUT THE U.S. TOUR OF HILL'S PHANTOM BEGAN THIS YEAR, LONG AFTER WEBBER'S HAD ESTABLISHED ITSELF IN NEW YORK.
THAT'S JONATHAN RINUS, ONE OF THE HILL VERSION'S PRODUCERS. <NOISE> RINUS' SAN FRANCISCO BASED THEATER IN THE SQUARE MOUNTED A TEN MONTH PRODUCTION OF HILL'S PHANTOM LATE LAST YEAR. <NOISE> AND THE PRODUCER SAYS NO ONE CONFUSED HIS SHOW WITH WEBBER'S.
WHEN TICKETS FOR THE WANG CENTER PRODUCTION OF HILL'S PHANTOM WENT ON SALE IN OCTOBER, <NOISE> THEATER GOERS FLOCKED TO THE BOX OFFICE SPURRED ON BY ADS WITH THE SHOW'S TITLE IN LARGE TYPE <NOISE> AND A DISCLAIMER DISTINGUISHING THE SHOW FROM WEBBER'S IN SMALL TYPE. <NOISE> AROUND THAT TIME, THE BOSTON GLOBE'S THEATER CRITIC, KEVIN KELLY, <NOISE> WROTE A SERIES OF ARTICLES ON THE TWO PHANTOMS. <NOISE> KELLY COULD NOT BE REACHED FOR COMMENT, <NOISE> BUT IN ONE PIECE HE SAID THAT IT IS ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE THAT HILL'S PHANTOM WOULD BE PLAYING A FOUR THOUSAND SEAT THEATER LIKE THE WANG, <NOISE> WITHOUT THE SUCCESS OF WEBBER'S PHANTOM. <NOISE> IN ANOTHER ARTICLE, HE WROTE THAT HORDES OF PEOPLE ARE BEING SUCKERED IN <NOISE> BY A SECOND- HAND VERSION OF PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. <NOISE> ANOTHER GLOBE ARTICLE REPORTED THAT PEOPLE IN LINE AT THE WANG CENTER THOUGHT THEY WERE BUYING TICKETS FOR WEBBER'S SHOW. <NOISE> AT LEAST SEVEN PIECES ON THE CONTROVERSY APPEARED IN THE SPACE OF A MONTH. <NOISE> NEITHER KELLY NOR THE REPORTER WHO WROTE THE REMAINING STORIES HAD SEEN HILL'S PHANTOM AT THE TIME.
MA SAYS THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED MEMBER F.D.C. CAN LEARN NOT ONLY FROM THE SUCCESSES, BUT ALSO FROM THE FAILURES OF EASTERN EUROPEAN REFORM. <NOISE> HE POINTS TO COUNTRIES SUCH AS CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND EAST GERMANY <NOISE> WHERE OPPOSITION LEADERS WERE CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY THE RAPID DEMISE OF THE COMMUNISTS <NOISE> AND ARE ONLY NOW TRYING TO FORM POLITICAL PARTIES. <NOISE> MA SAYS THE F.D.C. WILL BE READY TO STEP INTO A POWER VACUUM IN CHINA.
BUT THREE MONTH HISTORY OF THE F.D.C. HAS ALREADY SHOWN WHAT INTERNAL HURDLES THE GROUP MUST CLEAR BEFORE IT CAN PRESENT A UNITED FRONT. <NOISE> THERE'S DISAGREEMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, OVER WHAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP TO ESTABLISH WITH TAIWAN. <NOISE> TAIWANESE MONEY COULD HELP THE GROUP, <NOISE> BUT IT MIGHT OPEN THE F.D.C. UP TO CHARGES OF BEING A TAIWANESE PAWN. <NOISE> ALSO SAYS BOSTON UNIVERSITY CHINESE HISTORY PROFESSOR, MERLE GOLDMAN, <NOISE> THE GROUP SUFFERS FROM A GENERATION GAP BETWEEN STUDENTS LIKE WER KAI SHE <NOISE> AND THE MORE SEASONED POLITICAL THINKERS.
SCOFFIELD FOUND THAT THE REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TURBO TAX AND TAX CUT IS THE KIND OF HELP THEY GIVE YOU. <NOISE> TURBO TAX OFFERS THE EXACT I.R.S. INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH LINE AT THE PUSH OF A BUTTON. <NOISE> TAX CUT PROVIDES A COMPUTERIZED EXPERT WHO WILL WALK YOU THROUGH THE FORMS STEP BY STEP.
ALL N ALL, SCOFFIELD FOUND TAX CUT TO BE A BETTER PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT TAXES, <NOISE> ALTHOUGH HE FOUND ITS NUMEROUS HELP SCREEN SLOWED HIM DOWN. <NOISE> FOR THOSE WHO DON'T NEED AS MUCH HELP, HE RECOMMENDS TURBO TAX. <NOISE> AS FOR WHO SHOULD USE COMPUTER PROGRAMS IN THE FIRST PLACE, HE SAYS FOR BOTH VERY COMPLICATED AND VERY SIMPLE RETURNS, <NOISE> THEY PROBABLY AREN'T WORTH THE MONEY.
SO THE PEQUOTS WANT TO USE A NEW FEDERAL LAW TO EXPAND THEIR GAMING ACTIVITIES. <NOISE> THE LAW SAYS IF A STATE ALLOWS A CERTAIN GAME OF CHANCE, <NOISE> AN INDIAN TRIBE CAN NEGOTIATE WITH THE STATE TO OPERATE THAT GAME FOR PROFIT. <NOISE> CONNECTICUT DOES ALLOW SO-CALLED LAS VEGAS NIGHTS WHICH INCLUDE ROULETTE AND BLACK JACK GAMES, <NOISE> TO BE RUN FOR CHARITY. <NOISE> SO THE PEQUOTS WANT TO RUN THE SAME GAMES FOR HIGHER STAKES ON THE RESERVATION. <NOISE> THE STATE HOWEVER, WON'T HEAR OF IT.
CONNECTICUT ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL RICHARD SHERIDAN:
IN ADDITION TO JUNIOR PATRIARCA, SON OF THE FAMILY'S FOUNDER RAYMOND PATRIARCA SENIOR, <NOISE> THOSE ARRESTED YESTERDAY INCLUDED ALLEGED UNDER-BOSS NICHOLAS BIANCO <NOISE> AND ALLEGED MAFIA CAPTAIN MATHEW GUILLEMETTI. <NOISE> WHEN U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL DICK THORNBERG DETAILED THE CHARGES FACING THE SUSPECTS, <NOISE> THE HUGE SCOPE OF THE INVESTIGATION BECAME CLEAR.
C.L.T.'S PETITION WAS ONLY ONE OF FOUR DISCUSSED AT YESTERDAY'S HEARING, <NOISE> AND THE VERY FACT THAT FOUR PETITIONS EACH ALTERING TAX POLICY IN SOME WAY HAVE RECEIVED THOUSANDS OF VOTER'S SIGNATURES, <NOISE> ILLUSTRATES THE EXTENT OF PUBLIC FRUSTRATION OVER THE STATE'S BUDGET MESS. <NOISE> THE C.L.T. PROPOSAL IS THE ONLY ONE OF THE FOUR THAT WOULD RESULT IN A NET LOSS OF REVENUE. <NOISE> IT WOULD LOWER THE STATE'S INCOME TAX RATE TO FOUR AND A QUARTER PERCENT FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS, <NOISE> RETURNING TO TAX PAYERS THE MONEY CURRENTLY BEING RAISED BY A TEMPORARY TAX INCREASE. <NOISE> CRITICS SAY THE PLAN WILL ONLY COMPOUND THE STATE'S BALLOONING DEFICIT. <NOISE> C.L.T.'S FOUNDER BARBARA ANDERSON RESPONDED TO THOSE CHARGES YESTERDAY.
A SIMILAR MEASURE SPONSORED BY MOSES, A PUBLIC EMPLOYEES UNION, <NOISE> AND A PROPOSAL BY THE MASSACHUSETTS MUNICIPAL ASSOCIATION THAT WOULD REQUIRE LAWMAKERS TO GIVE A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE DIRECTLY TO LOCAL AID, <NOISE> ARE ALSO BEING DEBATED BY THE TAXATION COMMITTEE. <NOISE> SPONSORS OF ALL FOUR MEASURES DEFEND THEIR ATTEMPTS TO BYPASS LAWMAKERS WITH BALLOTS. <NOISE> JIM BRAUDY:
BUT CRITICS OF TAXATION BY INITIATIVE PETITION SAY IT'S THE PEOPLE'S DULY ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES, NOT THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES, <NOISE> WHO SHOULD BE WRITING THE TAX LAWS. <NOISE> RICHARD MANLEY IS PRESIDENT OF THE MASSACHUSETTS TAXPAYERS FOUNDATION.
A LARGE PORTION OF THE DEBATE CENTERED ON THE QUESTION OF WHO'S A POLITICAL INSIDER, <NOISE> WHOSE AN OUTSIDER AND WHY IT MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE. <NOISE> B.U. PRESIDENT SILBER REPEATEDLY TOUTED HIS OUTSIDER STATUS, <NOISE> SAYING IT'S BEACON HILL INSIDERS WHO CAUSED THE CURRENT FISCAL CRISIS. <NOISE> FRANK BELLOTTI WHOSE OUTSIDER LABEL HAS BEEN QUESTIONED RECENTLY, <NOISE> YESTERDAY USED THE TERM INDEPENDENT, <NOISE> AND JACK FLOOD ADMITTED HE'S INSIDER IN THAT HE KNOWS THE INS AND OUTS OF BEACON HILL, <NOISE> BUT SAYS HE'S REMAINED OUTSIDE THE MAIN STREAM OF LAWMAKERS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL CRISIS. <NOISE> FLOOD ALSO CRITICIZED SILBER'S RECENT HABIT OF MAKING CONTROVERSIAL REMARKS IN INTERVIEWS.
ANOTHER POINT OF CONTENTION WAS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S RULE REQUIRING A CANDIDATE TO RECEIVE FIFTEEN PERCENT OF CONVENTION DELEGATE'S SUPPORT, <NOISE> TO APPEAR ON THE PRIMARY BALLOT. <NOISE> BOTH SILBER AND FLOOD MAY HAVE TROUBLE REACHING THE FIFTEEN PERCENT MARK, <NOISE> AND SILBER HAS BEEN ACTIVELY CAMPAIGNING TO REPEAL THE RULE, <NOISE> WHICH PROMPTED THIS RESPONSE FROM FRONT-RUNNER BELLOTTI:
BOTH SILBER AND BELLOTTI ECHOED FLOOD'S CALL FOR A TAX HIKE. <NOISE> ON THE EMOTIONAL ISSUE OF ABORTION THOUGH, THERE WAS SHARP DISAGREEMENT. <NOISE> WHILE BELLOTTI DECLARED HIMSELF CLEARLY PRO-CHOICE, <NOISE> SILBER DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS MORALLY OPPOSED TO ABORTION, <NOISE> ALTHOUGH HE PLEDGED TO SUPPORT PRO-CHOICE POLICIES.
BUT JOHN FLOOD BLASTED SILBER FOR NOT FOLLOWING HIS MORAL BELIEFS.
IF PRESENT TRENDS CONTINUE, THIS YEAR IN MASSACHUSETTS APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN THOUSAND TEENAGERS WILL BECOME PREGNANT. <NOISE> THREE OF THEM ARE THESE STUDENTS AT SAINT MARGARET'S HOSPITAL ALTERNATIVE SCHOOL FOR PREGNANT TEENS. <NOISE> THEY ARE SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. <NOISE> TWO ARE FROM BOSTON. ONE IS FROM OUT OF TOWN.
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY-SIX, DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR MICHAEL DUKAKIS FULFILLED A CAMPAIGN PROMISE TO DE-POLITICIZE JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS. <NOISE> HE NAMED REPUBLICAN EDWARD HENNESSY TO HEAD THE STATE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT. <NOISE> FOR HENNESSY, IT WAS ANOTHER STEP ALONG A DISTINGUISHED CAREER THAT BEGAN AS A TRIAL LAWYER AND LED TO AN APPOINTMENT <NOISE> AS ASSOCIATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY-ONE. <NOISE> THAT YEAR THOMAS MAFFY, NOW PRESIDENT OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BAR ASSOCIATION, <NOISE> WAS HENNESSY'S LAW CLERK.
HENNESSY IS THE J.N.C.'S THIRTY-SECOND CHIEF JUSTICE. <NOISE> HOLDING THE COURT SYSTEM ON THE COURSE HE HAS SET AND PLOTTING IT'S FUTURE AGENDA <NOISE> WON'T BE AN EASY JOB FOR HIS SUCCESSOR.
ALL BUT ONE OF THE CHIEF JUSTICES SINCE EIGHTEEN NINETY-NINE, WHEN OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES WAS APPOINTED, CAME FROM THE RANKS OF J.N.C. ASSOCIATE JUSTICES. IF HE STICKS WITH TRADITION, DUKAKIS IS LIKELY TO ELEVATE ONE OF HIS APPOINTEES TO CHIEF. <NOISE> THAT MEANS PAUL LEOCOS OR RUTH ABRAMS, THE ONLY WOMAN ON THE COURT. ANOTHER POSSIBLE CHOICE IS HERBERT WILKINS, A GOVERNOR SARGENT APPOINTEE, <NOISE> AND NEXT TO HENNESSY, THE COURT'S MOST SENIOR MEMBER. <NOISE> THE OTHER THREE ASSOCIATE JUSTICES WERE PUT ON THE BENCH BY GOVERNOR EDWARD KING. AND MANY LAWYERS SAY THAT DESPITE DUKAKIS' PROMISE TO KEEP THE JUDICIARY ABOVE THE POLITICAL FRAY, <NOISE> IT'S UNLIKELY DUKAKIS WILL CHOOSE A KING APPOINTEE TO RUN THE STATE'S HIGHEST COURT. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
THE DEVICE IS ATTACHED TO A PLASTIC WRISTBAND. IT LOOKS LIKE A WATCH. IT FUNCTIONS LIKE AN ELECTRONIC PROBATION OFFICER. <NOISE> WHEN A COMPUTERIZED CALL IS MADE TO A FORMER PRISONER'S HOME PHONE, THAT PERSON ANSWERS BY PLUGGING IN THE DEVICE. THE WRISTBAND CAN BE REMOVED ONLY BY BREAKING ITS CLASP, <NOISE> AND IF THAT'S DONE THE INMATE IS IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO JAIL. <NOISE> THE DESCRIPTION CONJURES UP IMAGES OF BIG BROTHER WATCHING. BUT JAY ASH, DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF HAMPTON COUNTY JAIL IN SPRINGFIELD, SAYS <NOISE> THE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM IS NOT THAT SINISTER.
SUCH SUPERVISION, ACCORDING TO ASH, IS A SENSIBLE, COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION THAT SHOULD NOT ALARM CIVIL LIBERTARIANS. <NOISE> DOCTOR NORMAN ROSENBLATT, DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE AT NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY, AGREES.
MASSACHUSETTS MAY NOW HAVE THE TOUGHEST DRUNKEN DRIVING LAW IN THE NATION, THANKS TO THE SAFE ROADS ACT THAT BECAME LAW THIS WEEK. <NOISE> THE LEGISLATION CAME COMPLETE WITH A MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNOR TO THOSE SEEKING A LITTLE TOO MUCH COMFORT AND JOY THIS HOLIDAY SEASON AND BEYOND.
AND IN FACT THE STATE IS NOT PLANNING ON PUTTING MORE POLICE ON THE ROAD. <NOISE> STATE OFFICIALS SAY THERE WILL BE THE SAME LEVEL OF ENFORCEMENT. <NOISE> B.U.'S PROFESSOR HENKSEN BELIEVES THE KEY TO THE NEW LAW'S SUCCESS IS ITS ENFORCEMENT.
FORD AND OTHER OPPONENTS OF THE PER SE CLAUSE SAY IT RELIES EXCLUSIVELY ON THE BREATH TEST, <NOISE> AND THEY SAY BREATHALIZERS ARE SIMPLY UNRELIABLE. <NOISE> JOHN TARANTINO IS A PROVIDENCE ATTORNEY WHO SPECIALIZES IN DRUNKEN DRIVING CASES.
THEY DID. WITH THE SMALLER SWITCH, THE THREE TWENTY IS AN AWARD-WINNING DESIGN. <NOISE> THE TRIAD PROJECT, A WEEK-LONG CONFERENCE OF DESIGNERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD, WAS HOSTED BY THE CAMBRIDGE-BASED DESIGN MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE. <NOISE> THE GOAL: TO SHOW MANAGERS THAT DESIGN CAN BE USED AS A COMPETITIVE TOOL IN THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE. <NOISE> INSTITUTE DIRECTOR EARL POWELL.
MY TAPE MACHINE RECORDS WELL, BUT THE KNOBS ARE TOO SMALL, THE BUTTONS ARE FLIMSY, AND THE COUNTER MISPLACED.
THE TAPE RECORDER IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE CROSS-CULTURAL DIFFERENCES DESIGN ENGINEERS MUST CONTEND WITH. <NOISE> AMERICAN BATHROOM TAPS DIDN'T SELL WELL IN FRANCE BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO LOW: FRENCH WOMEN LIKE TO WASH THEIR HAIR IN THE SINK. <NOISE> BUT SOMETIMES CULTURAL DIFFERENCES CAN BE ADAPTED. <NOISE> PHILLIPS DEVELOPED A SPECIAL ELECTRIC RAZOR FOR JAPANESE MEN.
HENRY FORD ONCE TOLD HIS MODEL T CUSTOMERS: YOU CAN HAVE ANY COLOR YOU WANT, AS LONG AS IT'S BLACK. <NOISE> NOW CONSUMERS RULE. THE PACE OF INDUSTRIAL DESIGN IS QUICKENING, <NOISE> AIDED BY COMPUTER MODELING AND NEW MATERIALS, <NOISE> THE NEWEST WAVE OF PRODUCTS CAPITALIZING ON CONSUMER ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS. <NOISE> EARL POWELL OF THE DESIGN MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE.
ON HOLD RIGHT NOW: PLANS TO FIX ROUTE ONE TWENTY-EIGHT FROM RANDOLPH TO BRAINTREE, SCARRED WITH POTHOLES AND WHEEL RUTS. <NOISE> PLANS TO RESURFACE ROUTE NINE IN WINDSOR WILL HAVE TO WAIT. LIKEWISE, THE INFAMOUS ROUTE EIGHT A. IN SAVOY, A FOUR POINT FOUR MILE, BONE-JARRING, POTHOLED ROADWAY.
JANE GARVEY, COMMISSIONER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS ADMITS THERE IS A PROBLEM, BUT SAYS THERE'S A SOLUTION.
THE DUKAKIS ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO INCREASE THE ELEVEN-CENT-A-GALLON GAS TAX, ONE OF THE LOWEST IN THE NATION TO SEVENTEEN CENTS IMMEDIATELY, <NOISE> THEN TO TWENTY-ONE CENTS OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD, <NOISE> MAKING IT ONE OF THE HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY.
KEVIN KILEY, IS PRESIDENT OF THE TRUCKERS TRADE GROUP MASSACHUSETTS MOTOR TRANSPORTATION ASSOCIATION:
AGAIN, DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS COMMISSIONER JANE GARVEY:
ALREADY, ROAD CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES ARE GOING BANKRUPT, AND SOME TRUCKING FIRMS ARE MOVING OUT OF STATE. <NOISE> THE BIG QUESTION NOW IS WILL THE STATE HAVE THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IT NEEDS TO OBTAIN THE FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL MONEY TO BUILD THE CENTRAL ARTERY AND THIRD HARBOR TUNNEL? <NOISE> AND IF IT CAN GET THAT MONEY, WHERE WILL IT FIND FUNDS TO FIX THE OTHER STATE ROADS? <NOISE> A SENATE COMMITTEE WILL TAKE UP THAT ISSUE LATER THIS WEEK. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, THIS IS BRUCE GELLERMAN.
IN NINETEEN FIFTY-SEVEN, AT THE START OF A RECESSION, <NOISE> A YOUNG M.I.T. ENGINEER NAMED KEN OLSON TOOK HIS IDEA FOR A COMPUTER DESIGN TO MAYNARD, MASSACHUSETTS. <NOISE> THERE IN AN OLD MILL BUILDING, WHERE CLOTH FOR UNION ARMY UNIFORMS WAS ONCE MANUFACTURED, <NOISE> OLSON SET UP AN OFFICE WITH USED LAWN FURNITURE AND BEGAN BUILDING AN EMPIRE. <NOISE> DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION NOW EMPLOYS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE IN SEVENTY-TWO COUNTRIES. <NOISE> THIRTY-FOUR THOUSAND WORKERS ARE IN MASSACHUSETTS.
LABOR AND OFFICE SPACE WERE CHEAP IN MASSACHUSETTS, START-UP CAPITAL AND DEFENSE DEPARTMENT MONEY AVAILABLE, AND M.I.T. EXPERTISE NEARBY. DIGITAL, OR DEC, TOOK OFF. <NOISE> NOW, THE SECOND LARGEST COMPUTER COMPANY IN THE WORLD, DIGITAL, IS ONE OF THE MOST PROFITABLE COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES. <NOISE> OLSON IS STILL HEAD OF THE COMPANY HE FOUNDED WITH JUST SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS, <NOISE> AND HIS SUCCESS BECAME THE BLUEPRINT FOR SCORES OF OTHER M.I.T. TRAINED ENGINEER ENTREPRENEURS.
DIGITAL RECENTLY ANNOUNCED A BIG DROP IN PROFITS. FOUR THOUSAND TECHNICIANS ARE BEING RETRAINED FOR SALES. <NOISE> ONCE HIRING TEN THOUSAND WORKERS A YEAR, A PARTIAL HIRING AND WAGE FREEZE HAS NOW BEEN PROPOSED. <NOISE> AT WESTBOROUGH-BASED GENERAL DATA, THINGS ARE WORSE. <NOISE> AFTER THREE LOSING YEARS, PLANTS HAVE BEEN CLOSED, AND THREE THOUSAND WORKERS LET GO. <NOISE> AND WANG LABORATORIES IN LOWELL IS STRUGGLING FOR SURVIVAL. BORROWING HEAVILY, IT LOST MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR <NOISE> AND WILL SHED THREE THOUSAND WORKERS IN COMING MONTHS. <NOISE> THE EFFECTS ARE RIPPLING THROUGH THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY BUILT AROUND ONE TWENTY-EIGHT.
MASSACHUSETTS COMPUTER COMPANIES WERE BUILT LARGELY AROUND ONE KIND OF COMPUTER: THE MINICOMPUTER. <NOISE> BUT NOW, SEVENTY MINICOMPUTER MAKERS COMPETE FOR CUSTOMERS. AND BECAUSE NEWER WORKSTATIONS AND PERSONAL COMPUTERS ARE OFTEN FASTER AND CHEAPER, <NOISE> COMPANIES THAT RELIED ON THE MINICOMPUTER ARE SUFFERING.
PEDUSCA POINTS TO HIS WATCH AND PREDICTS THAT IN A FEW YEARS, IT WILL HAVE THE IMMENSE COMPUTING POWER OF THE WORKSTATIONS HE DEVELOPED AT PRIME IN NINETEEN SEVENTY-TWO. <NOISE> SMALLER AND SMALLER COMPUTERS AND THE FAILURE OF MASSACHUSETTS FIRMS TO ANTICIPATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, <NOISE> HELPED LEAD TO THE TROUBLES FACING JUST ABOUT ALL OF THE MAJOR COMPUTER COMPANIES IN THE STATE, ACCORDING TO GLENN RIFKIN.
TEN YEARS AGO, TWO UPSTART ENTREPRENEURS HAD ALIGNED WITH TANDY RADIO SHACK TO MARKET ONE UNDER ITS NAME. <NOISE> AND SOME BLAME MANAGEMENT FOR THE DELAY, SUGGESTING AGING ENTREPRENEURS SUFFERED FROM FOUNDERS' DISEASE, <NOISE> AN AFFLICTION WHERE SUCCESS CLOUDS THE VISION OF THE FUTURE. <NOISE> WILLIAM PEDUSCA FOUNDED TWO SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES, THEN WALKED AWAY.
SOME SAY AN WANG, THE BRILLIANT ENTREPRENEUR WHO FOUNDED WANG LABORATORIES, SHOULD HAVE RELINQUISHED CONTROL OF THE COMPANY LONG BEFORE HE HANDED IT OVER TO HIS SON. <NOISE> RECENTLY, AFTER RECORD LOSSES WERE ANNOUNCED, A NEW PRESIDENT WAS NAMED. <NOISE> BUT GLENN RIFKIN OF COMPUTER WORLD SAYS MORE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS PLAGUE MASSACHUSETTS COMPUTER INDUSTRY. <NOISE> COMPANIES MADE BILLIONS DEVELOPING THEIR OWN PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS. <NOISE> THAT IS, COMPUTERS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ANOTHER FIRM'S MACHINES. <NOISE> NOW, HOWEVER, RIFKIN SAYS THE MARKET DIRECTION HAS CHANGED.
WHAT WILL EMERGE WILL BE AN INDUSTRY VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE THAT NOW EXISTS. <NOISE> THE RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY THAT GAVE BIRTH TO THE COMPUTER COMPANIES IS NOW TRANSFORMING THEM.
COMPUTER SALES ARE SLUGGISH, AND THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE ECONOMICS OF THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY. <NOISE> THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHEAPER, FASTER MACHINES IS NARROWING PROFIT MARGINS, FORCING COMPANIES TO CUT DOWN ON OVERHEAD. <NOISE> WANG LABORATORIES AND DATA GENERAL ARE LOSING MONEY. <NOISE> AND EVEN GIANT DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION ANNOUNCED PROFITS WERE DOWN TWENTY-TWO PERCENT LAST QUARTER. <NOISE> STILL, DIGITAL WILL MAKE MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR, AND COMPANY PRESIDENT KEN OLSON IS OPTIMISTIC.
MORE THAN HALF OF AMERICA'S YOUNGSTERS HAVE HAD SEXUAL INTERCOURSE BY THE TIME THEY'RE SEVENTEEN <NOISE> AND MANY SELDOM USE BIRTH CONTROL, ACCORDING TO A RECENT LEWIS-HARRIS POLL SPONSORED BY PLANNED PARENTHOOD. <NOISE> ADVOCATES OF DISPENSING CONTRACEPTIVES IN SCHOOLS SEE THE POLL AS SUPPORTING THEIR CASE. <NOISE> OTHERS SAY EASIER AVAILABILITY OF BIRTH CONTROL FOR TEENAGERS WILL MAKE AN ALARMING SITUATION MUCH WORSE. THE ISSUE HAS ALREADY STIRRED HEATED DEBATE IN BOSTON <NOISE> WHERE IT'S BOUND TO SURFACE AGAIN. <NOISE> NEXT MONTH THE SUPERINTENDENT OF BOSTON PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS EXPECTED TO PUT THUMBS UP OR THUMBS DOWN ON A PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH CLINICS <NOISE> THAT WOULD AMONG OTHER THINGS DISPENSE BIRTH CONTROL DEVICES. WBUR'S MARGO MELNICOVE REPORTS.
THIS LAST YOUNG MOTHER-TO-BE IS LUCKIER THAN MANY. SHE AND THE FATHER OF HER CHILD ARE MARRIED AND ARE PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE, AND EVEN THOUGH SHE'S BEEN SEXUALLY ACTIVE SINCE SHE WAS TWELVE, SHE AVOIDED UNWANTED PREGNANCIES BY USING BIRTH CONTROL PILLS <NOISE> THAT HER MOTHER HELPED HER GET AT A LOCAL HOSPITAL. <NOISE> THESE THREE YOUNG WOMEN LIKE THE IDEA OF SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH CLINICS. IF ONE HAD EXISTED IN THEIR SCHOOLS, THEY SAY <NOISE> THEY WOULD HAVE USED IT FOR SOMEONE TO TALK TO ABOUT SEX AND FOR A SAFE PLACE TO GET BIRTH CONTROL. <NOISE> A PILOT PROJECT TO SET UP SUCH CLINICS IN TWO TO FOUR BOSTON MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS WAS PROPOSED LAST SPRING BY THE BOSTON STUDENT HUMAN SERVICE COLLABORATIVE. <NOISE> THE PLAN WAS ENDORSED LAST FALL BY THE ADOLESCENT ISSUE TASK FORCE SET UP BY THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. <NOISE> TASK FORCE MEMBER MARY CONROY, <NOISE> WHO DIRECTS FAMILY EDUCATION AT SAINT MARGARET'S, <NOISE> WAS ONE OF THE FEW DISSENTING VOICES AGAINST THE ENDORSEMENT.
THESE CLAIMS ARE DISPUTED BY THE HEAD OF THE TASK FORCE, DOCTOR DEBORAH PROTHROW-STITH. <NOISE> SHE SAYS SINCE STUDENTS DON'T USE EXISTING SERVICES, SCHOOL-BASED CLINICS WOULD BE AN ALTERNATIVE RATHER THAN A DUPLICATION. AND SHE SAYS, LIKE HEALTH CARE IN THE WORK PLACE, THE THRUST OF HEALTH CARE IN THE SCHOOLS <NOISE> IS TO OVERCOME ACCESS BARRIERS.
PROTHROW-STITH POINTS OUT THAT IF SCHOOL-BASED CLINICS WERE ESTABLISHED, PARENTAL PERMISSION WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR STUDENTS TO RECEIVE EACH SERVICE OFFERED, <NOISE> AND THAT BIRTH CONTROL WOULD ONLY BE A PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM DEALING WITH OTHER ADOLESCENT ISSUES LIKE DEPRESSION, SUICIDE AND EATING DISORDERS. <NOISE> SHE AGREES WITH MARY CONROY THAT THE ROOTS OF THESE PROBLEMS DIG DEEP INTO SOCIETY. <NOISE> BUT WHILE CONROY STRONGLY OPPOSES SCHOOL-BASED CLINICS AS A SOLUTION, CALLING THEM A BANDAID THAT WON'T WORK, PROTHROW-STITH SAYS BOTH ATTENTION TO TEENAGERS' IMMEDIATE NEEDS <NOISE> AS WELL AS LONG RANGE PREVENTION AND HEALTH EDUCATION ARE NEEDED.
PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSAL TO SET UP HEALTH CLINICS IN SCHOOLS ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO MULTIPLY, <NOISE> IF SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS LAVAL WILSON GOES ALONG WITH THE IDEA NEXT MONTH. THE BOSTON SCHOOL COMMITTEE, RELIGIOUS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS <NOISE> HAVE ALREADY COME TO LOGGERHEADS OVER THE ISSUE. <NOISE> FOR WBUR, I'M MARGO MELNICOVE.
